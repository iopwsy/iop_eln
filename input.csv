Zehmakan, Sujay Rastogi",New submissions,Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph),"Epidemic outbreaks pose significant challenges to public health and socio-economic stability, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of disease transmission dynamics and effective control strategies. This article discusses the limitations of traditional compartmental and network-based models and, inspired by the opinion formation models, introduces a room-based model that incorporates social gatherings and intuitive quarantine measures. Through simulations and analysis, we examine the impact of various model parameters, and confinement measures like quarantine and preventive measures like testing, and vaccination on disease spread. Additionally, we explore centrality-based testing and immunization strategies, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing the spread of diseases compared to a random approach. Finally, we propose a combined strategy, that outperforms the existing strategies. It takes both global and local properties of the network structure into account, highlighting the potential for integrated control measures in epidemic management. This research not only contributes to a deeper understanding of epidemic models, but also provides insights into devising successful intervention strategies, including quarantine measures, testing methodologies, and vaccine programs to combat emerging epidemics and pandemics "

Ulbricht",New submissions,Classical Physics (physics.class-ph),"In 1971, Zel'dovich predicted the amplification of electromagnetic (EM) waves scattered by a rotating metallic cylinder, gaining mechanical rotational energy from the body. Since then, this phenomenon has been believed to be unobservable with electromagnetic fields due to technological difficulties in meeting the condition of amplification, that is, the cylinder must rotate faster than the frequency of the incoming radiation. Here, we show that this key piece of fundamental physics has been hiding in plain sight for the past 60 years in the physics of induction generators. We measure the amplification of an electromagnetic field, generated by a toroid LC-circuit, scattered by an aluminium cylinder spinning in the toroid gap. We show that when the Zel'dovich condition is met, the resistance induced by the cylinder becomes negative implying amplification of the incoming EM waves. These results reveal the connection between the concept of induction generators and the physics of this fundamental effect that was believed to be unobservable, and hence open new prospects towards testing the Zel'dovich mechanism in the quantum regime, as well as related quantum friction effects.

2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 5,Fast quasi-centroid molecular dynamics for water and ice,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12246,"Joseph E. Lawrence, Annina Z. Lieberherr, Theo Fletcher, David E. Manolopoulos",New submissions,Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph),"We describe how the fast quasi-centroid molecular dynamics (f-QCMD) method can be applied to condensed phase systems by approximating the quasi-centroid potential of mean force as a sum of inter- and intra-molecular corrections to the classical interaction potential. The corrections are found by using a regularised iterative Boltzmann inversion procedure to recover the inter- and intra-molecular quasi-centroid distribution functions obtained from a path integral molecular dynamics simulation. The resulting methodology is found to give good agreement with a previously published QCMD dipole absorption spectrum for liquid water, and satisfactory agreement for ice. It also gives good agreement with spectra from a recent implementation of CMD that uses a pre-computed elevated temperature potential of mean force. Modern centroid molecular dynamics methods therefore appear to be reaching a consensus regarding the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the vibrational spectra of water and ice. "

Elliott, Marco Panesi, Daniel J. Bodony, Francesco Panerai",New submissions,Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex),"Inductively coupled plasma wind tunnels are crucial for replicating hypersonic flight conditions in ground testing. Achieving the desired conditions (e.g., stagnation-point heat fluxes and enthalpies during atmospheric reentry) requires a careful selection of operating inputs, such as mass flow, gas composition, nozzle geometry, torch power, chamber pressure, and probing location along the plasma jet. The study presented herein focuses on the influence of the torch power and chamber pressure on the plasma jet dynamics within the 350 kW Plasmatron X ICP facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A multi-domain analysis of the jet behavior under selected power-pressure conditions is presented in terms of emitted light measurements collected using high-speed imaging. We then use Gaussian Process Regression to develop a data-informed learning framework for predicting Plasmatron X jet profiles at unseen pressure and power test conditions. Understanding the physics behind the dynamics of high-enthalpy flows, particularly plasma jets, is the key to properly design material testing, perform diagnostics, and develop accurate simulation models "
2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 7,Micro-seismic Elastic Reflection Full Waveform Inversion with An  Equivalent Source,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12323,"Hanchen Wang, Qiang Guo, Tariq Alkhalifah",New submissions,Geophysics (physics.geo-ph),"In micro-seismic event measurements, pinpointing the passive source's exact spatial and temporal location is paramount. This research advocates for the combined use of both P- and S-wave data, captured by geophone monitoring systems, to improve source inversion accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the secondary source concept in Elastic Reflection Full Waveform Inversion (ERFWI), we introduce an equivalent source term. This term combines source functions and source images. Our optimization strategy iteratively refines the spatial locations of the source, its temporal functions, and associated velocities using a full waveform inversion framework. Under the premise of an isotropic medium with consistent density, the source is defined by two spatial and three temporal components. This offers a nuanced source representation in contrast to the conventional seismic moment tensor. To address gradient computation, we employ the adjoint-state method. However, we encountered pronounced non-linearity in waveform inversion of micro-seismic events, primarily due to the unknown source origin time, resulting in cycle skipping challenges. To counteract this, we devised an objective function that is decoupled from the source origin time. This function is formulated by convolving reference traces with both observed and predicted data. Through the concurrent inversion of the source image, source time function, and velocity model, our method offers precise estimations of these parameters, as validated by a synthetic 2D example based on a modified Marmousi model. This nested inversion approach promises enhanced accuracy in determining the source image, time function, and velocity model. "

Hocky",New submissions,Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph),"Small mechanical forces play important functional roles in many crucial cellular processes, including in the dynamical behavior of the cytoskeleton and in the regulation of osmotic pressure through membrane-bound proteins. Molecular simulations offer the promise of being able to design the behavior of proteins that sense and respond to these forces. However, it is difficult to predict and identify the effect of the relevant piconewton (pN) scale forces due to their small magnitude. Previously, we introduced the Infinite Switch Simulated Tempering in Force (FISST) method which allows one to estimate the effect of a range of applied forces from a single molecular dynamics simulation, and also demonstrated that FISST additionally accelerates sampling of a molecule's conformational landscape. For some problems, we find that this acceleration is not sufficient to capture all relevant conformational fluctuations, and hence here we demonstrate that FISST can be combined with either temperature replica exchange or solute tempering approaches to produce a hybrid method that enables more robust prediction of the effect of small forces on molecular systems.

Diddams, Franklyn Quinlan, John Bowers, Owen Miller, Peter Rakich",New submissions,Optics (physics.optics),"The unique benefits of Fabry-P\'erot resonators as frequency-stable reference cavities and as an efficient interface between atoms and photons make them an indispensable resource for emerging photonic technologies. To bring these performance benefits to next-generation communications, computation, and timekeeping systems, it will be necessary to develop strategies to integrate compact Fabry-P\'erot resonators with photonic integrated circuits. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel reflection cancellation circuit that utilizes a numerically optimized multi-port polarization-splitting grating coupler to efficiently interface high-finesse Fabry-P\'erot resonators with a silicon photonic circuit. This circuit interface produces spatial separation of the incident and reflected waves, as required for on-chip Pound-Drever-Hall frequency locking, while also suppressing unwanted back reflections from the Fabry-P\'erot resonator. Using inverse design principles, we design and fabricate a polarization-splitting grating coupler that achieves 55% coupling efficiency. This design realizes an insertion loss of 5.8 dB for the circuit interface and more than 9 dB of back reflection suppression, and we demonstrate the versatility of this system by using it to interface several reflective off-chip devices.

Electricity systems hold particular significance, as they are essential for other infrastructure, and disruptions can trigger widespread consequences. Typically, assessing electricity availability requires ground-level data, a challenge in conflict zones and regions with limited access. This study shows how satellite imagery, social media, and information extraction can monitor blackouts and their perceived causes. Night-time light data (in March 2019 for Caracas, Venezuela) is used to indicate blackout regions. Twitter data is used to determine sentiment and topic trends, while statistical analysis and topic modeling delved into public perceptions regarding blackout causes. The findings show an inverse relationship between nighttime light intensity. Tweets mentioning the Venezuelan President displayed heightened negativity and a greater prevalence of blame-related terms, suggesting a perception of government accountability for the outages. "
2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 11,Adaptive Fine-tuning based Transfer Learning for the Identification of  MGMT Promoter Methylation Status,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12373,"Erich Schmitz, Yunhui Guo, Jing Wang",New submissions,Medical Physics (physics.med-ph),"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive form of malignant brain tumor with a generally poor prognosis. Treatment usually includes a mix of surgical resection, radiation therapy, and akylating chemotherapy but, even with these intensive treatments, the 2-year survival rate is still very low. O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been shown to be a predictive bio-marker for resistance to chemotherapy, but it is invasive and time-consuming to determine the methylation status. Due to this, there has been effort to predict the MGMT methylation status through analyzing MRI scans using machine learning, which only requires pre-operative scans that are already part of standard-of-care for GBM patients. We developed a 3D SpotTune network with adaptive fine-tuning capability to improve the performance of conventional transfer learning in the identification of MGMT promoter methylation status. Using the pretrained weights of MedicalNet coupled with the SpotTune network, we compared its performance with two equivalent networks: one that is initialized with MedicalNet weights, but with no adaptive fine-tuning and one initialized with random weights. These three networks are trained and evaluated using the UPENN-GBM dataset, a public GBM dataset provided by the University of Pennsylvania. The SpotTune network showed better performance than the network with randomly initialized weights and the pre-trained MedicalNet with no adaptive fine-tuning. SpotTune enables transfer learning to be adaptive to individual patients, resulting in improved performance in predicting MGMT promoter methylation status in GBM using MRIs as compared to conventional transfer learning without adaptive fine-tuning.

The effective interaction length is longer than 1~mm, limited by dephasing of the accelerated particles in the structure. The piezo-based independent mounting system for the gratings allows tuning of the gap and field distribution inside the structure. "
2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 13,What is the meaning of physical quantity $ν$ in the expression of  photon energy $hν$?,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12390,"Xingchu Zhang, Weilong She",New submissions,Optics (physics.optics),"It is well known that, for an incident light of not so high intensity and in a certain range of frequency, the stopping voltage of photoelectric effect is independent of the intensity but dependent on the frequency of the light, which is described by the equation $V = h\nu /e - {W_0}/e$, where $V$ is the stopping voltage, $h$ is the Planck constant, $\nu$ is the frequency of incident light, $e$ is the electron charge, and $W_0$ is the work function. It means that the larger the frequency of incident light, the higher the stopping voltage is. However, the present experiment finds that for a non-monochromatic incident light, the stopping voltage is not determined by the maximum frequency component of the incident light, but by the maximum center frequency of all the wave train components (with different center frequencies) involved in the incident light, that is to say, in the photon energy expression $h\nu$, physical quantity $\nu$ does not refer to the frequency of a monochromatic light, but represents the center frequency of a wave train spectrum. The spectral bandwidth of a wave train component can be as large as 122 nm in visible and near-infrared region. This should arouse more attention in the study of energy exchange between light and matter. "

Time-resolved observation of electron emission and surface temperature is realized in addition to the typical steady state characterization. Surface cooling by the electron emission, initiated by plasma ignition, is directly captured at its onset and an estimated cooling capacity of 1.6 \pm 0.2 MW/m^2 is observed. The present work provides experimental evidence of considerable surface cooling achieved by thermionic cooling. This result indicates that thermionic cooling can be a promising thermal protection method at elevated temperatures, such as those encountered by hypersonic vehicle leading edges in flight. "

Ivanov, Kyung Taec Kim",New submissions,Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"We present results of relativistic calculations of even order harmonic generation from various atomic targets. The even order harmonics appear due to the relativistic non-dipole effects. We take these relativistic effects into account by using an approach based on the solution of the time-dependent Dirac equation. The spectra of the non-dipole even harmonics look qualitatively similar to the spectra of the dipole harmonics obeying the same classical cutoff rule. The temporal dynamics of the formation of the non-dipole harmonics is, however, distinctly different from the process of dipole harmonics formation. Even order harmonics emission is strongly suppressed at the beginning of the laser pulse, and the emission times of the non-dipole harmonics are shifted with respect to the bursts of the dipole emission. These features are partly explained by a simple modification of the classical three-step model which takes into account selection rules governing the emission of harmonic photons. "

The stability region in the fractional part of the horizontal and the vertical betatron tune space as a function of the linear coupling strength, has been obtained, and the increment/decrement of the horizontal and the vertical betatron oscillations in the case of the linear sum resonance has been shown to be approximately equal to the half of the coupling strength. The normal form parameterization of the one-turn linear map with horizontal-to-vertical coupling has been developed in detail in the spirit of the Edwards and Teng formalism. The motion in the normal mode in the new normal form coordinates is decoupled implying that two independent Courant-Snyder invariants exist, which have been found explicitly. "

We introduce a non-dimensional parameter 'Bead Ratio'($BR$), that is, the ratio of bead diameter to the film height. When both the $BR$ and its distance from the nozzle exceed critical values, selection mechanism leading to development of 'dominating' waves: from regularly spaced droplets to coarsening or droplet merging. The two mechanisms, influenced by the $BR$ for a single bead, contribute to droplet merging: the formation of the downstream healing length, which precipitates the initial stage, and it's oscillating behaviour resulting in droplet merging. When the bead position is away from the healing length far from the nozzle, the transient simulations capture behavior similar to the finite amplitude perturbations at the inlet. However, when the bead is within the healing length, the film evolution has only coarsening effect on the droplet spacing. When the bead spacing on a granular chain is less than the droplet spacing of a Rayleigh-Plateau regime is significantly altered. "

A linear analysis is conducted by combining the averaged flow-scale momentum equation with the averaged particle-scale heat exchange equation. A flow mode of regular oscillation, which is triggered by the heat exchange process between every single particle and its surrounding fluid element, is predicted by this model. Three time scales, namely $\tau_f $, $\tau_p$, and $\Delta t$, are shown to be involved in the heat exchange process, giving significance to the temperature distribution inside the single particle. By assuming $\tau_f / \tau_p \gg 1$, the detailed correlation between the oscillation period and $\kappa_p / \kappa_f $ is established, suggesting a flow mode transition with the change of heat diffusivity ratio of particle to fluid.

Characterization of a detector's NR response is crucial for underground DM direct detection projects. The traditional calibrating methods characterize a detector with $\sim$ keV - MeV neutrons emitted from an accelerator, a neutron generator, or a radioactive source. These methods could be improved in several aspects: (a) the neutrons's energy could be more mono-energetic, (b) the to-be-calibrated NR energy should line up with the ROI (Research Of Interest) of the experiment, (c) the calibrating beam's flux should be appropriate. Accordingly, in the paper, we introduce a novel calibration method in which the beam of the target material (instead of neutrons) will be implemented to impinge the detector. For instance, calibrating a liquid helium detector with a helium beam. Since the helium beam can (i) be tuned precisely to have $\sim < $1\% energy jitter (so as the recoil energy's uncertainty), (ii) have an energy interval from $\sim$ 100 eV to tens of keV (depending on the configuration), and (iii) have a tunable flux down to 10$^{10}$/s. Since these unique advantages can also be applied to other noble gases; therefore, we believe the method can be implemented to calibrate other liquid noble gas detectors' NR response. "
2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 20,Quantitative evaluation of simultaneous spatial and temporal  regularization in liver perfusion studies using low-dose dynamic  contrast-enhanced CT,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12499,"Kenya Murase, Atsushi Nakamoto, Noriyuki Tomiyama",New submissions,Medical Physics (physics.med-ph),"The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the performance of different simultaneous spatial and temporal regularizers in liver perfusion studies using low-dose dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT). A digital liver phantom was used to simulate chronic liver disease (CLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on clinical data. Low-dose DCE-CT images were reconstructed using regularizers and a primal-dual algorithm. Subsequently, hepatic perfusion parameter (HPP) images were generated using a dual-input single-compartment model and linear least-squares method. In the CLD model, the effect of regularizers on the input functions (IFs) was examined by calculating the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the IFs, and the HPP estimation accuracy was evaluated by calculating the error and coefficient of variation (CV) between the HPP values obtained by the above methods and true values. In the HCC model, the ratios of the mean HPP values inside and outside the tumor were calculated. The AUCs of IFs decreased with increasing regularization parameter (RP) values. Although the AUC of arterial IF did not significantly depend on the regularizers, that of portal IF did. The error and CV were reduced using low-rank and sparse decomposition (LRSD). Total generalized variation (TGV) combined with LRSD (LTGV) was generally superior to the other regularizers in terms of HPP estimation accuracy and range of available RP values in both the CLD and HCC models. However, striped artifacts were more remarkable in the HPP images obtained by the TGV and LTGV than in those obtained by the other regularizers. The results suggest that the LRSD and LTGV are useful for improving the accuracy of HPP estimation using low-dose DCE-CT and for enhancing its practicality. This study will help select a suitable regularizer and/or RP value for low-dose DCE-CT liver perfusion studies. "

We then solve the quantum magnetohydrodynamics equations to obtain a new analytical form of the dynamic structure factor (DSF), a fundamental quantity linking theory and experiments. Our results show that the three-peak structure -- one central Rayleigh peak and two Brillouin peaks -- of the DSF arising from quantum hydrodynamic fluctuations becomes (in general) a five-peak structure -- one central Rayleigh peak and two pairs of peaks associated with fast and slow magnetosonic waves. The Bohm contribution influences the positions and characteristics (height, width, and intensity) of the peaks by introducing three significant modifications: (a) an increase in effective thermal pressure, (b) a reduction in the adiabatic index, and (c) an enhancement of effective thermal diffusivity. The multiple DSF peaks enable concurrent measurements of diverse plasma properties, transport coefficients, and thermodynamic parameters in magnetized dense plasmas. The potential for experimental validation of our theory looms large, particularly through future experiments conducted at state-of-the-art laser facilities. "

As a result, more enriched physics is expected for a dual-phase detector than a single-phase one. However, to build such a detector, DC HV (High Voltage) must be delivered into the chamber (to have a static electric field), which is a challenging task, especially for an LHe detector due to the extremely low temperature, $\sim$ 4 K, and the very high voltage, $\sim$ MV (Million Volts). This article introduces a convincing design for transmitting $\sim$ MV DC into a 4 K LHe detector. We also report the progress of manufacturing a 100 kV DC feedthrough capable of working at 4 K.

In present work, we investigate electroconductive properties and sintering behaviour of thin films produced from nanostructures of different metals (Ag, Cu and Cu-Ag) and different shapes (nanowires and spherical nanoparticles), and compare them to the reference Ag and Cu magnetron deposited films. Synthesized nanostructures were studied with transmission electron microscopy. Morphology and crystallinity of produced metal films were studied with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrical parameters were measured by the van der Pauw method. All nanowires-based films provided high conductivity and required only modest thermal treatment (200 C). To achieve sufficient sintering and conductivity of nanoparticles-based films, higher temperatures are required (300 C for Ag nanoparticles and 350 C for Cu and Cu-Ag nanoparticles). Additionally, stability of nanowires was studied by annealing the samples in vacuum conditions inside a scanning electron microscope at 500 C. "
2023-10-20 Physics New submissions 24,Real space iterative reconstruction for vector tomography (RESIRE-V),https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12513,"Minh Pham, Xingyuan Lu, Arjun Rana, Stanley Osher, Jianwei Miao",New submissions,Medical Physics (physics.med-ph),"Tomography has had an important impact on the physical, biological, and medical sciences. To date, most tomographic applications have been focused on 3D scalar reconstructions. However, in some crucial applications, vector tomography is required to reconstruct 3D vector fields such as the electric and magnetic fields. Over the years, several vector tomography methods have been developed. Here, we present the mathematical foundation and algorithmic implementation of REal Space Iterative REconstruction for Vector tomography, termed RESIRE-V. RESIRE-V uses multiple tilt series of projections and iterates between the projections and a 3D reconstruction. Each iteration consists of a forward step using the Radon transform and a backward step using its transpose, then updates the object via gradient descent. Incorporating with a 3D support constraint, the algorithm iteratively minimizes an error metric, defined as the difference between the measured and calculated projections. The algorithm can also be used to refine the tilt angles and further improve the 3D reconstruction. To validate RESIRE-V, we first apply it to a simulated data set of the 3D magnetization vector field, consisting of two orthogonal tilt series, each with a missing wedge. Our quantitative analysis shows that the three components of the reconstructed magnetization vector field agree well with the ground-truth counterparts. We then use RESIRE-V to reconstruct the 3D magnetization vector field of a ferromagnetic meta-lattice consisting of three tilt series. Our 3D vector reconstruction reveals the existence of topological magnetic defects with positive and negative charges. We expect that RESIRE-V can be incorporated into different imaging modalities as a general vector tomography method. "

The force is, however, less sensitive to alternation of atom species than to tip-sample separations, resulting in the difficulty of compositional identification, even under multi-modal strategies and other AFM variations. Here, we report a phenomenon of light enhancement of van der Waals force (LvF), and the enhancement factor is found specific to materials. The force difference prior and after illumination, instead of the tip-specimen force itself, is employed for discriminating heterogeneous phases. The corresponding LvF microscopy (LvFM) demonstrates not only a ultra-high compositional resolution represented by 20 dB enhancement factor and 150 times of the detection limit, but also a sub-10 nm lateral spatial resolution much smaller than the tip size of 20 nm. The simplicity of the opto-thermal mechanism, minuteness of excitation light power and wide availability of boosting lasers at various wavelengths imply broad applications of LvFM on nano-materials characterization, particularly on two-dimensional semiconductors that are promising as new generation of chip materials.

For over a century, scientists have therefore sought to accumulate a precise knowledge and understanding of their thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural properties. However, the vast majority of electrolyte properties have not or cannot be determined empirically, despite being key to understanding a huge range of biological and chemical processes and systems. In this work, we introduce a long-sought-after solution to this problem and employ it to develop a detailed understanding of an electrolyte solution: aqueous lithium chloride. Our solution draws from recent breakthroughs in machine learning, first principles quantum chemistry and statistical mechanics and lets us develop and run truly predictive all-atom and coarse-grained simulations using long-range corrected equivariant neural network potentials (NNP). Surprisingly, our calculations reveal the formation of Li cation dimers. This previously unknown species highlights the power of the approach to divulge new understanding of electrolytes. Key electrolyte properties, including activity and diffusion coefficients, are determined from first principles and validated in close agreement with experiment. The training data is a small set (655 frames) of moderate-cost density corrected density functional theory (DC-DFT) calculations, meaning the approach can be scaled to build a database of electrolyte solution properties.

Borisov, D. A. Zezyulin",New submissions,Optics (physics.optics); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"It has been recently shown that complex two-dimensional (2D) potentials $V_\varepsilon(x,y)=V(y+\mathrm{i}\varepsilon\eta(x))$ can be used to emulate non-Hermitian matrix gauge fields in optical waveguides. Here $x$ and $y$ are the transverse coordinates, $V(y)$ and $\eta(x)$ are real functions, $\varepsilon>0$ is a small parameter, and $\mathrm{i}$ is the imaginary unit. The real potential $V(y)$ is required to have at least two discrete eigenvalues in the corresponding 1D Schr\""odinger operator. When both transverse directions are taken into account, these eigenvalues become thresholds embedded in the continuous spectrum of the 2D operator. Small nonzero $\varepsilon$ corresponds to a non-Hermitian perturbation which can result in a bifurcation of each threshold into an eigenvalue. Accurate analysis of these eigenvalues is important for understanding the behavior and stability of optical waves propagating in the artificial non-Hermitian gauge potential. Bifurcations of complex eigenvalues out of the continuum is the main object of the present study. We obtain simple asymptotic expansions in $\varepsilon$ that describe the behavior of bifurcating eigenvalues. The lowest threshold can bifurcate into a single eigenvalue, while every other threshold can bifurcate into a pair of complex eigenvalues. These bifurcations can be controlled by the Fourier transform of function $\eta(x)$ evaluated at certain isolated points of the reciprocal space. When the bifurcation does not occur, the continuous spectrum of 2D operator contains a quasi-bound-state which is characterized by a strongly localized central peak coupled to small-amplitude but nondecaying tails. The analysis is applied to the case examples of parabolic and double-well potentials $V(y)$. In the latter case, the bifurcation of complex eigenvalues can be dampened if the two wells are widely separated. "

Data-driven forecasts based on the method of analogues are made employing a set of precomputed time series segments of flow fields. These predictions are then corrected with the evolved deviation between initial flow state and its nearest neighbor in the database. The evolution of these deviations is obtained from the convolution with the propagator of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, where linearization takes place around the most similar state in the database. The error $E_{\textrm{lin}}$ due to this approximation implies the appropriate distance function to determine nearest-neighbor fields. We tested the method on the simple case of 2D vortex shedding behind a cylinder at Reynolds numbers in the range of 200 with step sizes of up to 200 times larger than those used to generate the underlying data with the PISO algorithm. Short-term forecasts showed a high degree of accuracy with errors correlating well with $E_{\textrm{lin}}$ for a number of case variations. But also after many steps, the predicted flow fields remained in close agreement with high-fidelity CFD calculations with relative errors on the order of 1% for the temporal averages. Furthermore, excellent conservation behavior of global properties like total momentum and kinetic energy was observed. "

This latter approach proves compliant with demanding environments, such as a vibrating pulse tube cryostat operating at low temperature, and it is demonstrated both in the telecom band and in the near infrared close to 900 nm of wavelength. The versatility, stability, and high coupling efficiency of this method are promising for quantum optics and sensing experiments in constrained environments, where obtaining high signal-to-noise ratio remains a challenge.

Recent work has shown that bulk cytoplasmic flows, driven by cortical contractions along the walls of the embryo, enable the uniform spreading of nuclei along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis necessary for proper embryonic development. Here we propose two mathematical models to characterise cytoplasmic flows driven by tangential cortical contractions in elongated cells. Assuming Newtonian fluid flow at low Reynolds number in a spheroidal cell, we first compute the flow field exactly, thereby bypassing the need for numerical computations. We then apply our results to recent experiments on nuclear transport in cell cycles 4-6 of Drosophila embryo development. By fitting the cortical contractions in our model to measurements, we reveal that experimental cortical flows enable near-optimal axial spreading of nuclei. A second mathematical approach, applicable to general elongated cell geometries, exploits a long-wavelength approximation to produce an even simpler solution, with errors below 5% compared to the full model. An application of this long-wavelength result to transport leads to fully analytical solutions for the nuclear concentration that capture the essential physics of the system, including optimal axial spreading of nuclei.

Fritzsche",New submissions,Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph),"Relying on the redefined vacuum state approach, and based on one-particle three-loop Feynman diagrams, partial third-order interelectronic corrections to the valence electron energy shift are investigated in Li-like ions. The idea is to begin with simple one-particle gauge-invariant subsets composed of Feynman diagrams and to keep track of them in the many-electron frame, which is a strong asset of the formalism. An independent derivation is undertaken with the help of perturbation theory to cross-check the expressions. This two-method scheme helps to resolve how the different terms are distributed among three- and four-electron contributions. Furthermore, it provides a tool to overcome the difficulties related to the derivation of reducible terms, which are tricky to deal with. These two independent derivations and the comparison of the resulting expressions are fully consistent, except for two expressions. In these cases, the discrepancy can be traced back to a different topology of the poles. "

However, it remains unclear whether these synergies hold true at higher levels of hydrogen demand and how they compare with benefits of off-grid, islanded hydrogen production, such as better renewable resources and cost savings on electronics due to relaxed power quality standards. Using a mathematical model across two geographical locations for Germany, Spain, Australia, and Great Britain, we explore trade-offs and synergies between integrated and islanded electrolysers. Below a certain threshold, between 5% and 40% hydrogen share depending on the country, integrated electrolysers offer synergies in flexibility and reduced curtailment. Above these thresholds, islanded electrolysers become more favourable. Without cost advantages, systems including islanded electrolysers in Germany achieve up to 21% lower hydrogen costs than systems with only integrated electrolysers. With 25% island cost advantage, this benefit rises to 40% lower hydrogen costs. Our study identifies three investment regimes with country-specific transition points that vary based on island cost advantages and each country's renewable resources. Based on our results we provide guidelines for countries considering how to deploy electrolysers. "

The new system exhibits dynamical properties which bear strong similarity with those observed for the Burgers equation and can be understood using the dynamics of the poles, shocks and truncation effects such as tygers. A complex interplay of these give rise to interesting statistical regimes ranging from hydrodynamic behaviour to a completely thermalized warm phase. The end of the hydrodynamic regime is associated with the appearance of a shock in the solution and a continuous transition leading to a truncation dependent state. Beyond this, the truncation effects such as tygers and appearance of secondary discontinuity at the resonance point in the solution strongly influence the statistical properties. These disappear at the second transition, at which the global quantities exhibit a jump and attain values that are consistent with the establishment of a 'quasi-equilibrium' state characterized by energy equipartition among the Fourier modes. Our comparative analysis shows that the macroscopic statistical properties of the formally time-reversible system and the Burgers equation are equivalent in all the regimes, irrespective of the truncation effects, and this equivalence is not just limited to the hydrodynamic regime, thereby further strengthening the Gallavotti's equivalence conjecture. The properties of the system are further examined by inspecting the complex space singularities in the velocity field of the Burgers equation. Furthermore, an effective theory is proposed to describe the discontinuous transition. "

The target neutrino-mass sensitivity of 0.2 eV / c^2 at 90% C.L. can only be achieved in the case of high statistics and a good control of the systematic uncertainties. One key systematic effect originates from the calculation of the molecular final states of T_2 beta decay. In the first neutrino-mass analyses of KATRIN the contribution of the uncertainty of the molecular final-states distribution (FSD) was estimated via a conservative phenomenological approach to be 0.02 eV^2 / c^4. In this paper a new procedure is presented for estimating the FSD-related uncertainties by considering the details of the final-states calculation, i.e. the uncertainties of constants, parameters, and functions used in the calculation as well as its convergence itself as a function of the basis-set size used in expanding the molecular wave functions. The calculated uncertainties are directly propagated into the experimental observable, the squared neutrino mass m_nu^2. With the new procedure the FSD-related uncertainty is constrained to 0.0013 eV^2 / c^4, for the experimental conditions of the first KATRIN measurement campaign. "

Often only time-averaged data is available, which poses challenges for DA in the context of unsteady flow problems. Recent works have shown promising results in optimizing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of stationary flows using sparse data through variational data assimilation, enabling the reconstruction of mean flow profiles. In this study we perform three-dimensional variational data assimilation of sparse time-averaged data into an unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation by means of a stationary divergence-free forcing term in the URANS equations. Efficiency and speed of our method are enhanced by employing coarse URANS simulations and leveraging the stationary discrete adjoint method for the time-averaged URANS equations. The data assimilation codes were developed in-house using OpenFOAM for the URANS simulations as well as for the solution of the adjoint problem, and Python for the gradient-based optimization. Our results demonstrate that data assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity measurements not only enables accurate mean flow reconstruction, but also improves the flow dynamics, specifically the vortex shedding frequency. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we applied it to turbulent flows around cylinders of various shapes at Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 22000. Our findings indicate that data points near the cylinder play a crucial role in improving the vortex shedding frequency, while additional data points further downstream are necessary to also reconstruct the time-averaged velocity field in the wake region.

Koyroytsaltis-McQuire, Rahul Kumar, Tamas Javorfi, Giuliano Siligardi, Nikolaj Gadegaard, Malcolm Kadodwala",New submissions,Optics (physics.optics),"Chiral materials display a property called optical activity, which is the capability to interact differentially with left and right circularly polarised light. This leads to the ability to manipulate the polarisation state of light, which has a broad range of applications spanning from energy efficient displays to quantum technologies. Both synthesised and engineered chiral nanomaterials are exploited in such devices. The design strategy for optimising the optical activity of a chiral material is typically based on maximising a single parameter, the electric dipole magnetic dipole response. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach of controlling optical activity by manipulating both the dipole and multipolar response of a nanomaterial. This provides an additional parameter for material design, affording greater flexibility. The exemplar systems used to illustrate the strategy are nanofabricated chiral silicon structures. The multipolar response of the structures, and hence their optical activity, can be controlled simply by varying their height. This phenomenon allows optical activity and the creation of so called superchiral fields, with enhanced asymmetries, to be controlled over a broader wavelength range, than is achievable with just the electric dipole magnetic dipole response. This work adds to the material design toolbox providing a route to novel nanomaterials for optoelectronics and sensing applications. "

One approach for periodic domains involves utilising a compact or exponentially decaying kernel function to spread the force on the structure to a regular grid where the resulting flow and interactions can be computed efficiently using an FFT-based solver. A limitation to this approach is that the grid spacing must be chosen to resolve the kernel and thus, these methods can become inefficient when the separation between the structures is large compared to the kernel width. In this paper, we address this issue for the force-coupling method (FCM) by introducing a modified kernel that can be resolved on a much coarser grid, and subsequently correcting the resulting interactions in a pairwise fashion. The modified kernel is constructed to ensure rapid convergence to the exact hydrodynamic interactions and a positive-splitting of the associated mobility matrix. We provide a detailed computational study of the methodology and establish the optimal choice of the modified kernel width, which we show plays a similar role to the splitting parameter in Ewald summation. Finally, we perform example simulations of rod sedimentation and active filament coordination to demonstrate the performance of fast FCM in application. "

Essential to many of these applications is the control of the comb's defining parameters, i.e., carrier-envelope offset frequency and repetition rate. An elegant and all-optical approach to controlling both degrees of freedom is the suitable injection of a secondary continuous-wave laser into the resonator onto which one of the comb lines locks. Here, we study experimentally such sideband injection locking in microresonator soliton combs across a wide optical bandwidth and derive analytic scaling laws for the locking range and repetition rate control. As an application example, we demonstrate optical frequency division and repetition rate phase-noise reduction to three orders of magnitude below the noise of a free-running system. The presented results can guide the design of sideband injection-locked, parametrically generated frequency combs with opportunities for low-noise microwave generation, compact optical clocks with simplified locking schemes and more generally, all-optically stabilized frequency combs from Kerr-nonlinear resonators.

Recent works have proposed solutions to the problem of reconstructing the hidden multiplexity of single-layer networks using tools proper of network science. Here, we develop a machine learning framework that takes advantage of graph embeddings, i.e., representations of networks in geometric space.

One of the perceived advantages of proton arc therapy is the reduced treatment time, but it is still unclear exactly how long these treatment times will be, given that no machine capable of its delivery is available at the market at the time of writing. Purpose: We introduce the algorithm Arc Trajectory Optimization Method (ATOM), which aims to determine an efficient velocity profile for the gantry for rapid delivery of a given proton arc treatment plan. Methods: ATOM computes the trajectory with the shortest delivery time while ensuring there is enough time to deliver all spots in each energy layer and switch energy between layers. The feasibility of the dynamic gantry movement was assured by enforcing maximum and minimum limits for velocity, acceleration, and jerk. This was achieved by discretizing the gantry velocity and combining the A* algorithm with the open-source motion generation library Ruckig. The algorithm was tested on a synthetic data set as well as a liver case, a prostate case and a head and neck case. Results: Arc trajectories for plans with 360 energy layers were calculated in under a second using 256 discrete velocities. Conclusions: ATOM is an open-source C++ library with a Python interface that rapidly generates velocity profiles, making it a highly efficient tool for determining proton arc delivery times, which could be integrated into the treatment planning process.

We derive the coarse-grained behavior of our model via an effective theory for linear networks that we show is analogous to a deformed Ginzburg-Landau model with quenched disorder. This framework predicts (depth-dependent) disorder-order-disorder phase transitions in the parameters' solutions that reveal the onset of a collective learning phase, along with a depth-induced delay of the critical point and a robust shape of the microscopic learning path. We validate our theory in realistic ensembles of coupled nonlinear networks trained in the MNIST dataset under privacy constraints. Interestingly, experiments confirm that individual networks -- trained only with private data -- can fully generalize to unseen data classes when the collective learning phase emerges.

In addition, we apply the isotropic finite difference method to calculate derivatives, and the current scheme readily accommodates adaptive mesh refinement, greatly enhancing efficiency. We rigorously validate the hybrid CSF using two benchmark problems that have received limited attention in previous studies of the three-phase VOF method. Using the hybrid CSF method, we accurately predict the behavior of a liquid lens under specific surface tension ratios. Furthermore, the simulation results of the equilibrium morphology of two contacting droplets are consistent with the theoretical expectations. "

Finally, we observe the temporal change in ROS signals under control, static and gradient magnetic fields. For exposure to static and gradient magnetic fields, the peak in ROS signals occurs after 24 hours and 36 hours, respectively. "

Wirth, Matthias Wuttig, Thomas Taubner",New submissions,Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),"Tailoring light-matter interaction is essential to realize nanophotonic components. It can be achieved with surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs), an excitation of photons coupled with phonons of polar crystals, which also occur in 2d materials such as hexagonal boron nitride or anisotropic crystals. Ultra-confined resonances are observed by restricting the SPhPs to cavities. Phase-change materials (PCMs) enable non-volatile programming of these cavities based on a change in the refractive index. Recently, the new plasmonic PCM In$_3$SbTe$_2$ (IST) was introduced which can be reversibly switched from an amorphous dielectric state to a crystalline metallic one in the entire infrared to realize numerous nanoantenna geometries. However, reconfiguring SPhP resonators to modify the confined polaritons modes remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate direct programming of confined SPhP resonators by phase-switching IST on top of a polar silicon carbide crystal and investigate the strongly confined resonance modes with scanning near-field optical microscopy. Reconfiguring the size of the resonators themselves result in enhanced mode confinements up to a value of $\lambda/35$. Finally, unconventional cavity shapes with complex field patterns are explored as well. This study is a first step towards rapid prototyping of reconfigurable SPhP resonators that can be easily transferred to hyperbolic and anisotropic 2d materials. "

Stephens",New submissions,Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC),"How do we capture the breadth of behavior in animal movement, from rapid body twitches to aging? Using high-resolution videos of the nematode worm $C. elegans$, we show that a single dynamics connects posture-scale fluctuations with trajectory diffusion, and longer-lived behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy partition so that transitions among microstates define a high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into movement using resistive force theory, capturing the statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both ``runs-and-pirouettes'' as well as previously uncharacterized finer-scale behaviors. We use our model to investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and global search strategies. "

By coupling the equations of motion of the body to a quasi-potential flow model of the fluid, we derive expressions for the drift speed and propulsive thrust of the body which in turn are shown to be consistent with global momentum conservation. We explore the efficacy of our model in describing the motion of SurferBot [Rhee et al., Bioinspir. Biomim. 17 (5), 2022], demonstrating close agreement with the experimentally determined drift speed and oscillatory dynamics. The efficiency of wave-driven propulsion is then computed as a function of driving oscillation frequency and the forcing location, revealing optimal values for both of these parameters which await confirmation in experiments. A comparison to other modes of locomotion and applications of our model to competitive water-sports are discussed in conclusion. "

For the problem at stake, the strong form of the principle of exchange of stabilities has been proved, i.e. convective motions can occur only through a secondary stationary motion. We perform linear and nonlinear stability analyses of the basic state motion, with particular regard to the behaviour of the stability thresholds with respect to the relevant physical parameters characterizing the model. The Chebyshev-$\tau$ method and the shooting method are employed and implemented to solve the differential eigenvalue problems arising from linear and nonlinear analyses to determine critical Rayleigh numbers. Numerical simulations prove the stabilising effect of upper bounding plane temperature, Darcy's number and the interaction coefficient characterising the local thermal non-equilibrium regime. "

Juel",New submissions,Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS),"Using experiments and a depth-averaged numerical model, we study instabilities of two-phase flows in a Hele-Shaw channel with an elastic upper boundary and a non-uniform cross-section prescribed by initial collapse. Experimentally, we find increasingly complex and unsteady modes of air-finger propagation as the dimensionless bubble speed, Ca, and level of collapse are increased, including pointed fingers, indented fingers and the feathered modes first identified by Cuttle et al.(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 886, 2020, A20). By introducing a measure of the viscous contribution to finger propagation, we identify a Ca threshold beyond which viscous forces are superseded by elastic effects. Quantitative prediction of this transition between 'viscous' and 'elastic' reopening regimes across levels of collapse establishes the fidelity of the numerical model. In the viscous regime, we recover the non-monotonic dependence on Ca of the finger pressure, which is characteristic of benchtop models of airway reopening. To explore the elastic regime numerically, we extend the depth-averaged model introduced by Fontana et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 916, 2021, A27) to include an artificial disjoining pressure which prevents the unphysical self-intersection of the interface. Using time simulations, we capture for the first time the majority of experimental finger dynamics, including feathered modes. We show that these disordered states continually evolve, with no evidence of convergence to steady or periodic states. We find that the steady bifurcation structure satisfactorily predicts the bubble pressure as a function of Ca, but that it does not provide sufficient information to predict the transition to unsteady dynamics which appears strongly nonlinear.

Existing methods typically rely on generic indicators to rank node influence across diverse networks, thereby ignoring the individualized features of each network itself. Actually, node influence stems not only from general features but the multi-scale individualized information encompassing specific network structure and task. Here we design an active learning architecture to predict node influence quantitively and precisely, which samples representative nodes based on graph entropy correlation matrix integrating multi-scale individualized information. This brings two intuitive advantages: (1) discovering potential high-influence but weak-connected nodes that are usually ignored in existing methods, (2) improving the influence maximization strategy by deducing influence interference. Significantly, our architecture demonstrates exceptional transfer learning capabilities across multiple types of networks, which can identify those key nodes with large disputation across different existing methods. Additionally, our approach, combined with a simple greedy algorithm, exhibits dominant performance in solving the influence maximization problem. This architecture holds great potential for applications in graph mining and prediction tasks. "

We show that magnetoresistance becomes strong (of order 100 %) at relatively small fields, at which the inverse square of the magnetic length becomes comparable to disorder-induced variations of the electron density. The mechanism responsible for this anomalously strong magnetoresistance can be traced to the appearance of magnetic friction force in liquids with nonvanishing intrinsic conductivity. We derive general results for the galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic kinetic coefficients, and obtain their dependence on the intrinsic dissipative properties of the electron liquid, and the correlation function of the disorder potential. We apply this theory to graphene close to charge neutrality and cover the crossover to a high-density regime. "

We then extend this to a phenomenological field theory, in which non mean-field behavior emerges as a result of the disorder in the network structure. We predict that the upper critical dimension for such systems is $d_u$=4 using a Gaussian approximation. Moreover, we identify an order parameter for the phase transition, which has been lacking for fiber networks to date. "

We apply it to the accurate numerical study of acoustic radiation in the neighborhood of a sound-hard two-dimensional staircase modeled after the El Castillo pyramid. Such staircases support trapped waves which travel along the surface and decay exponentially away from it. We use the array scanning method (Floquet--Bloch transform) to recover the scattered field as an integral over the family of quasiperiodic solutions parameterized by their on-surface wavenumber. Each such BIE solution requires the quasiperiodic Green's function, which we evaluate using an efficient integral representation of lattice sum coefficients. We avoid the singularities and branch cuts present in the array scanning integral by complex contour deformation. For each frequency, this enables a solution accurate to around 10 digits in a couple of seconds. We propose a residue method to extract the limiting powers carried by trapped modes far from the source. Finally, by computing the trapped mode dispersion relation, we use a simple ray model to explain an observed acoustic ""raindrop"" effect (chirp-like time-domain response). "

A nominally phase-pure beta-Ga2O3 film was obtained at 530 degrees. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations of the gamma-Ga2O3 film grown at 470 degrees revealed a high density of antiphase boundaries. A planar defect model developed for gamma-Al2O3 was extended to explain the stacking sequences of the Ga sublattice observed in the STEM images of gamma-Ga2O3. The presence of the 180-degree rotational domains and 90-degree rotational domains of beta-Ga2O3 inclusions within the gamma-Ga2O3 matrix is discussed within the context of a comprehensive investigation of the epitaxial relationship between those two phases in the as-grown film at 470 degrees and the same film annealed at 600 degress. The results led to the hypotheses that (i) incorporation of certain dopants including Si, Ge, Sn, Mg, Al, and Sc, into beta-Ga2O3, locally stabilizes the ""gamma-phase"" and (ii) the site preference(s) for these dopants promotes the formation of the ""gamma-phase"" and/or gamma-Ga2O3 solid solutions. However, in the absence of such dopants, pure gamma-Ga2O3 remains the least stable Ga2O3 polymorph, as indicated by its very narrow growth window, lower growth temperatures relative to other Ga2O3 polymorphs, and the largest calculated difference in Helmholtz free energy per formula unit between gamma-Ga2O3 and beta-Ga2O3 than all other polymorphs.

Here we use the tip of a scanning probe microscope to lift a perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecule from a metal surface to bring it into an open-shell spin one-half anionic state. We reveal a correlation between the appearance of a Kondo resonance in the differential conductance spectroscopy and concurrent characteristic changes captured by the TERS measurements. Through a detailed investigation of various adsorbed and tip-contacted PTCDA scenarios, we infer that the Raman scattering on the suspended PTCDA is resonant with a higher excited state. Theoretical simulation of the vibrational spectra enables a precise assignment of the individual TERS peaks to high-symmetry Ag modes, including the fingerprints of the observed spin state.

In indirect reciprocity, an individual chooses whether or not to cooperate with another based on reputation information, and others evaluate the action as good or bad. Under what evaluation rule (called ``social norm'') cooperation evolves has long been of central interest in the literature. It has been reported that if individuals can share their evaluations (i.e., public reputation), social norms called ``leading eight'' can be evolutionarily stable. On the other hand, when they cannot share their evaluations (i.e., private assessment), the evolutionary stability of cooperation is still in question. To tackle this problem, we create a novel method to analyze the reputation structure in the population under private assessment. Specifically, we characterize each individual by two variables, ``goodness'' (what proportion of the population considers the individual as good) and ``self-reputation'' (whether an individual thinks of him/herself as good or bad), and analyze the stochastic process of how these two variables change over time. We discuss evolutionary stability of each of the leading eight social norms by studying the robustness against invasions of unconditional cooperators and defectors. We identify key pivots in those social norms for establishing a high level of cooperation or stable cooperation against mutants. Our finding gives an insight into how human cooperation is established in a real-world society. "

These fluctuations, which accompany the overall deformation behavior representing an essentially slower stress evolution controlled by the work hardening, were processed using complementary approaches comprising the Fourier spectral analysis, the refined composite multiscale entropy, and multifractal formalisms. The joint analysis at distinct scales testified that even a macroscopically smooth plastic flow is accompanied with nonrandom fluctuations, disclosing self-organized dynamics of dislocations. Qualitative changes in such a fine-scale ""noise"" were found with varying temperature.

Particularly in this work, we study the impact of these network features on targeted intervention (e.g., self-isolation and quarantine). The targeted individuals for self-isolation are based on centrality measures and node influence metrics. Compared to our previous works on scale-free networks, small-world networks are considered in this paper. Small-world networks resemble real-world social and human networks. In this type of network, most nodes are not directly connected but can be reached through a few intermediaries (known as the small-worldness property). Real social networks, such as friendship networks, also exhibit this small-worldness property, where most people are connected through a relatively small number of intermediaries. We particularly study the epidemic curve flattening by centrality-based interventions/isolation over small-world networks. Our results show that high clustering while having low small-worldness (higher shortest path characteristics) implies flatter infection curves. In reality, a flatter infection curve implies that the number of new cases of a disease is spread out over a longer period of time, rather than a sharp and sudden increase in cases (a peak in epidemic). In turn, this reduces the strain on healthcare resources and helps to relieve the healthcare services. "

Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.

Matthias Geilhufe",Cross-lists,Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"We investigate the halide perovskite TiF$_3$, renowned for its intricate interplay between structure, electronic correlations, magnetism, and thermal expansion. Despite its simple structure, understanding its low-temperature magnetic behavior has been a challenge. Previous theories proposed antiferromagnetic ordering. In contrast, experimental signatures for an ordered magnetic state are absent down to 10~K. Our current study has successfully reevaluated the theoretical modeling of TiF$_3$, unveiling the significance of strong electronic correlations as the key driver for its insulating behavior and magnetic frustration. In addition, our frequency-dependent optical reflectivity measurements exhibit clear signs of an insulating state. Analysis of the calculated magnetic data gives an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling with a net Weiss temperature of order 25~K as well as a magnetic response consistent with a $S$=1/2 local moment per Ti$^{3+}$. Yet, the system shows no susceptibility peak at this temperature scale and appears free of long-range antiferromagnetic order down to 1~K. Extending ab initio modeling of the material to larger unit cells shows a tendency for relaxing into a non-collinear magnetic ordering, with a shallow energy landscape between several magnetic ground states, promoting the status of this simple, nearly cubic perovskite structured material as a candidate spin liquid.

Here we present our findings on electrical switching of antiferromagnetic state in Mn3Sn/Cr, where despite the much smaller spin Hall angle of Cr, the switching current density is comparable to heavy metal based heterostructures. On the other hand, the inverse process, i.e., spin-to-charge conversion in Cr-based heterostructures is much less efficient than the Pt-based equivalents, as manifested in the almost one order of magnitude smaller terahertz emission intensity and spin current induced magnetoresistance in Cr-based structures. These results in combination with the slow decay of terahertz emission against Cr thickness (diffusion length of ~11 nm) suggest that the observed magnetic switching can be attributed to orbital current generation in Cr, followed by efficient conversion to spin current. Our work demonstrates the potential of light metals like Cr as an efficient orbital/spin current source for antiferromagnetic spintronics. "

Based on the free-swimming robotic fish platform, we investigated how the erected dorsal fin affects the speed, cost of transport (COT), and robotic fish's yaw angle at different frequencies and amplitudes. The erected dorsal fin plays a positive role in improving the yaw stability of robotic fish. However, it shows little influence on the speed and COT in our test. This remains to be further investigated in the future. "

Probability currents provide such a measure in terms of the rate at which they enclose area in phase space. We measure this area enclosing rate for trapped colloidal particles, where only one particle is driven. By combining experiment, theory, and simulation, we single out the effect of the different time scales in the system on the measured probability currents. In this controlled experimental setup, particles interact hydrodynamically. These interactions lead to a strong spatial dependence of the probability currents and to a local influence of athermal agitation. In a multiple-particle system, we show that even when the driving acts only on one particle, probability currents occur between other, non-driven particles. This may have significant implications for the interpretation of fluctuations in biological systems containing elastic networks in addition to a suspending fluid. "

We derive new well-posed boundary conditions for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear problems. For nonlinear problems, entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solutions, however, it does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could ruin numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively tames oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates poisonous high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of sub-critical flows typical observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWE. We verify convergence, accuracy and well-balanced property via the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) and canonical test problems such as the dam break, lake at rest, and a two-dimensional rotating and merging vortex problem.

In the field of scientific communication, they have been perceived in a more positive light, and the accounts that serve as feeds alerting about scientific publications are quite common. However, despite being aware of the presence of bots in the dissemination of science, no large-scale estimations have been made nor has it been evaluated if they can truly interfere with altmetrics. Analyzing a dataset of 3,744,231 papers published between 2017 and 2021 and their associated 51,230,936 Twitter mentions, our goal was to determine the volume of publications mentioned by bots and whether they skew altmetrics indicators. Using the BotometerLite API, we categorized Twitter accounts based on their likelihood of being bots. The results showed that 11,073 accounts (0.23% of total users) exhibited automated behavior, contributing to 4.72% of all mentions. A significant bias was observed in the activity of bots. Their presence was particularly pronounced in disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, and Space Sciences, with some specialties even exceeding 70% of the tweets. However, these are extreme cases, and the impact of this activity on altmetrics varies by speciality, with minimal influence in Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences.

Of these, the CB and CH chondrites are thought to have formed in an impact-generated vapor-melt plume from material that may be isotopically akin to CR chondrites. We report Mo, Ti, Cr, and Hf-W isotopic data for CB and CH chondrites in order to determine their formation time, to assess whether these chondrites are genetically related, and to evaluate their potential link to CR chondrites. An internal Hf-W isochron for the CH chondrite Acfer 182 yields an age of 3.8 +- 1.2 Ma after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), which is indistinguishable from the mean Hf-W model age for CB metal of 3.8 +- 1.3 Ma. The Mo isotopic data for CB and CH chondrites indicate that both contain some of the same metal and silicate components, which themselves are isotopically distinct. As such, the different Mo isotopic compositions of bulk CB and CH chondrites reflect their distinct metal-to-silicate ratios. CR metal exhibits the same Mo isotopic composition as CB and CH metal, but CR silicates have distinct Mo and Ti isotopic compositions compared to CB and CH silicates, indicating that CB/CH chondrites may be genetically related to CR metal, but not to CR silicates. Together, the new isotopic data are consistent with formation of CB and CH chondrites in different regions of a common impact-generated vapor- melt plume and suggest that the CB and CH metal may derive from a metal-rich precursor genetically linked to CR chondrites. The Hf-W systematics of CH and CB chondrites indicate that the impact occurred at 3.8 +- 0.8 Ma after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions and, hence, up to ~1 Ma earlier than previously inferred based on Pb- Pb chronology.

Using the van der Waals (vdW) system in an optical cavity as an example, we predict the effects of interference and collectivity in cavity-induced many-body dispersion interactions. Specifically, the leading order correction due to cavity-induced quantum fluctuations leads to 3-body and 4-body vdW interactions, which can align intermolecular vectors and are not pairwise additive. In addition, the cavity-induced dipole leads to a single-molecule energy shift that aligns individual molecules, and a pair-wise interaction that scales as $R^{-3}$ instead of the standard $R^{-6}$ distance scaling. The coefficients of all these cavity-induced corrections depend on the cavity frequency and are renormalized by the effective Rabi frequency, which in turn depends on the particle density. Finally, we study the interaction of the vdW system in a cavity with an external object and find a significant enhancement in the interaction range due to modified distance scaling laws. These theoretical predictions suggest the possibility of cavity-induced nematic or smectic order and may provide an essential clue to understanding intriguing phenomena observed in optical cavities, such as strongly-modified ground-state reactivity, ion transport and solvent polarity.

Boriskina",Cross-lists,Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Optics (physics.optics),"There is a need for compact, dynamically tunable nonreciprocal optical elements to enable on-chip-compatible optical isolators and more efficient radiative energy transfer systems. Plasmon Fizeau drag, the drag of electrical current on propagating surface plasmon polaritons, has been proposed to induce nonreciprocal surface modes to enable one-way energy transport. However, relativistic electron drift velocities are required to induce appreciable contrast between the dispersion characteristics of co-propagating and counter-propagating surface plasmon modes. The high electron drift velocity of graphene previously allowed for the experimental demonstration of current-induced nonreciprocity in a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material. The high electron drift and Fermi velocities in three-dimensional (3D) Dirac materials make them ideal candidates for the effect, however, both the theory of the Fizeau drag effect and its experimental demonstrations in 3D Dirac materials are missing. Here we develop a comprehensive theory of Fizeau drag in DC-biased 3D Weyl semimetals (WSM) or Dirac semimetals (DSM), both under local and non-local approximation and with dissipative losses. We predict that under practical assumptions for loss, Fizeau drag in the DSM Cd$_3$As$_2$ opens windows of pseudo-unidirectional transport. We additionally introduce new figures of merit to rank nonreciprocal plasmonic systems by their potential for directional SPP transport. Further, we propose a new approach for achieving appreciable plasmonic Fizeau drag via optically pumping bulk inversion symmetry breaking WSMs or DSMs. "

The microphysical processes that determine whether an incoming particle will be transmitted or reflected are poorly understood. We study the microphysics of particle reflection in Weibel-mediated shocks by tracking a shell of test particles in a PIC simulation of a shock in pair plasma. We find that electrons in positron-dominated filaments and positrons in electron-dominated filaments efficiently reflect off of strong magnetic structures at the shock. These reflected particles headed towards the upstream must then find filaments of the same sign of current as the current carried by the reflected particles in order to successfully move with the shock and participate in diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The final injection efficiency on the order of about 1% thus results from the effectiveness of the initial reflection at the shock and the reflected particles' probability of survival in the upstream post-reflection. We develop a model that predicts the fraction of high-energy particles as a function of the properties of Weibel filamentation. "

The Vendi Score was introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics. Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the Vendi scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in terms of memorization, duplication, diversity, and sample quality. "

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid analog-digital protocol designed for the non-adiabatic yet high-fidelity transfer of edge states in a SSH chain, featuring two sublattices A and B. The core of our approach lies in harnessing the approximate time-dependent counter-diabatic (CD) interaction, derived from adiabatic gauge potentials. However, to enhance transfer fidelity, particularly in long-distance chains, higher-order nested commutators become crucial. To simplify experimental implementation and navigate computational complexities, we identify the next-to-nearest-neighbour (NNN) hopping terms between sublattice A as dominant CD drivings, and further optimize them by using variational quantum circuits. Through digital quantum simulation, our protocol showcases the capability to achieve rapid and robust solutions, even in the presence of disorder. This analog-digital transfer protocol, an extension of quantum control methodology, establishes a robust framework for edge state transfer. Importantly, the optimal CD drivings identified can be seamlessly implemented across various quantum registers, highlighting the versatility of our approach. "

Necessary conditions are derived for the existence of optimal $(N,M)$-POVMs. One of these necessary conditions exhibits a close connection between the existence of optimal informationally complete $(N,M)$-POVMs and the existence of isospectral, traceless, orthonormal, hermitian operator bases in cases, in which the parameter $M$ exceeds the dimension of the quantum system under consideration. Another necessary condition is derived for optimal $(N,M)$-POVMs, whose parameter $M$ is less than the dimension of the quantum system. It is shown that in these latter cases all POVM elements necessarily are projection operators of equal rank. This significantly constrains the possible parameters for constructing optimal $(N,M)$-POVMs. For the special case of $M=2$ a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of optimal $(N,2)$-POVMs is presented.

Currently, no open-source simulator includes all following capabilities: channel attenuation modelling, equipment imperfections and effect on key rates, estimation of elapsed time during quantum channel processes, use of truly random binary sequences for qubits and measurement bases, shared-bit fraction customization.

We consider a one-dimensional chain of point particles interacting with each other by scattering the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field confined to one dimension. We develop a fast, efficient algorithm for calculating the forces on each particle and apply it to study the macroscopic limit of infinitely many, infinitely weak scatterers. The force density converges for piece-wise homogeneous media, but diverges in inhomogeneous media, which would cause instant collapse in theory. We argue that short-range counter forces in the medium prevent this collapse in reality. Their effect appears as the renormalization of the Casimir stress in dielectrics.

Estimating mutual information (MI) plays a critical role to investigate the relationship among multiple random variables with a nonlinear correlation. Particularly, the task to determine whether they are independent or not is called the independence test, whose core subroutine is estimating MI from given data. It is a fundamental tool in statistics and data analysis that can be applied in a wide range of application such as hypothesis testing, causal discovery and more. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating mutual information using the quantum kernel. We investigate the performance under various problem settings, such as different sample size or the shape of the probability distribution. As a result, the quantum kernel method showed higher performance than the classical one under the situation that the number of samples is small, the variance is large or the variables posses highly non-linear relationships. We discuss this behavior in terms of the central limit theorem and the structure of the corresponding quantum reproducing kernel Hilbert space. "

It is found that in addition to the decay factor encoding channel, the antisymmetric coupling breaking gives rise to another phase factor encoding channel. We introduce an optimal measurement for the generalized dephasing qubit which enables the practical measurement precision to reach the theoretical ultimate precision quantified by the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). As an example, the generalized dephasing qubit is employed to estimate the $s$-wave scattering length of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. It is found that the phase-induced QSNR caused by the antisymmetric coupling breaking is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the decay-induced QSNR at the millisecond timescale and the optimal relative error can achieve a scaling $\propto 1/t$ with $t$ being the encoding time in long-term encoding. Our work opens a way for supersensitive sensing of quantum reservoirs. "

Hollenberg, Muhammad Usman",New submissions,Quantum Physics (quant-ph),"With quantum devices rapidly approaching qualities and scales needed for fault tolerance, the validity of simplified error models underpinning the study of quantum error correction needs to be experimentally evaluated. In this work, we have directly assessed the performance of superconducting devices implementing heavy-hexagon code syndrome measurements with increasing circuit sizes up to 23 qubits, against the error assumptions underpinning code threshold calculations. Data from 16 repeated syndrome measurement cycles was found to be inconsistent with a uniform depolarizing noise model, favouring instead biased and inhomogeneous noise models. Spatial-temporal correlations investigated via $Z$ stabilizer measurements revealed significant temporal correlation in detection events. These results highlight the non-trivial structure which may be present in the noise of quantum error correction circuits and support the development of noise-tailored codes and decoders to adapt. "

Recent experiments have shown that this can be achieved by momentum transfer from a surface precursor via ion irradiation, an approach known as ``recoil implantation.'' Here, we extend this technique to incorporate dielectric precursors for creating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond. Specifically, we demonstrate that gallium focused-ion-beam exposure to a thin layer of silicon nitride or silicon dioxide on the diamond surface results in the introduction of both extrinsic impurities and carbon vacancies. These defects subsequently give rise to near-surface NV and SiV centers with desirable optical properties after annealing. "

We construct the ground state and excited states using the coupled-cluster Ansatz and find excellent agreement with the exact diagonalization results for a small number of lattice sites. We then present the simulation protocol for the time evolution of the model using CV gates and obtain numerical results using a photonic quantum simulator.

Recently, it was shown that a version of this protocol, where the engineered environment consists of one or more dissipative qubit ancillas tuned to be resonant with the low-energy transitions of a many-body system, resulted in the combined system evolving to reasonable approximation to the ground state. This potentially broadens the applicability of the method beyond non-frustrated systems, to which it was previously restricted. Here we argue that this approach has an intrinsic limitation because the ancillas, seen as an effective bath by the system in the weak-coupling limit, do not give the detailed balance expected for a true zero-temperature environment. Our argument is based on the study of a similar approach employing linear coupling to bosonic ancillas. We explore overcoming this limitation using a recently developed technique from open-quantum-systems called pseudomodes. With a simple example model of a 1D quantum Ising chain, we show that detailed balance can be fixed, and a more accurate estimation of the ground state obtained, at the cost of two additional unphysical dissipative modes and the extrapolation error of implementing those modes in physical systems.

Their experimental realization is challenging, in particular using propagating fields, where quantum information is encoded in the quadratures of the electromagnetic field. However, travelling photons are essential in many applications of GKP codes involving the long-distance transmission of quantum information. We introduce a new method for encoding GKP states in propagating fields using single photons, each occupying a distinct auxiliary mode given by the propagation direction. The GKP states are defined as highly correlated states described by collective continuous modes, as time and frequency. We analyze how the error detection and correction protocol scales with the total photon number and the spectral width. We show that the obtained code can be corrected for displacements in time-frequency phase space - which correspond to dephasing, or rotations, in the quadrature phase space - and to photon losses. Most importantly, we show that generating two-photon GKP states is relatively simple, and that such states are currently produced and manipulated in several photonic platforms where frequency and time-bin biphoton entangled states can be engineered.

Starting from a Floquet description of the driven system, we derive effective low-energy Hamiltonians by projecting out the high-energy degrees of freedom and treating intrinsic interactions on a mean field level. We then investigate how the emergence of high-energy Frenkel excitons from the electronic interband coupling, which form near the upper electronic band, affects the interactions as well as the laser-induced Floquet renormalization of the electronic band structure. Cavity-mediated interactions are enhanced strongly when the light couples to an excitonic transition. Additionally, the interaction as well as the Floquet renormalization are strongly broadened in reciprocal space, which could further boost the impact of cavity-mediated interactions on the driven-dissipative steady state.

The state of a donor nuclear spin qubit can be manipulated and read out using its hyperfine interaction with the electron confined by the donor potential. Here we use a master equation-based approach to investigate how the backaction from this electron-mediated measurement affects the lifetimes of single and multi-donor qubits. We analyze this process as a function of electric and magnetic fields, and hyperfine interaction strength. Apart from single nuclear spin flips, we identify an additional measurement-related mechanism, the nuclear spin flip-flop, which is specific to multi-donor qubits. Although this flip-flop mechanism reduces qubit lifetimes, we show that it can be effectively suppressed by the hyperfine Stark shift. We show that using atomic precision donor placement and engineered Stark shift, we can minimize the measurement backaction in multi-donor qubits, achieving larger nuclear spin lifetimes than single donor qubits.

Self-testing allows a classical verifier to infer a quantum mechanical description of untrusted quantum devices that she interacts with in a black-box manner. Somewhat contrary to the black-box paradigm, existing self-testing results tend to presuppose conditions that constrain the operation of the untrusted devices. A common assumption is that these devices perform a projective measurement of a pure quantum state. Naturally, in the absence of any prior knowledge it would be appropriate to model these devices as measuring a mixed state using POVM measurements, since the purifying/dilating spaces could be held by the environment or an adversary. We prove a general theorem allowing to remove these assumptions, thereby promoting most existing self-testing results to their assumption-free variants. On the other hand, we pin-point situations where assumptions cannot be lifted without loss of generality. As a key (counter)example we identify a quantum correlation which is a self-test only if certain assumptions are made. Remarkably, this is also the first example of a correlation that cannot be implemented using projective measurements on a bipartite state of full Schmidt rank. Finally, we compare existing self-testing definitions, establishing many equivalences as well as identifying subtle differences. "

To address this issue, multiple rounds of syndrome extraction are typically employed to obtain reliable error syndromes. In this paper, we consider phenomenological decoding problems, where data qubit errors may occur between two syndrome extractions, and each syndrome measurement can be faulty. To handle these diverse error sources, we define a generalized check matrix over mixed quaternary and binary alphabets to characterize their error syndromes. This generalized check matrix leads to the creation of a Tanner graph comprising quaternary and binary variable nodes, which facilitates the development of belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithms to tackle phenomenological errors. Importantly, our BP decoders are applicable to general sparse quantum codes. Through simulations of quantum memory protected by rotated toric codes, we demonstrates an error threshold of 3.3% in the phenomenological noise model. Additionally, we propose a method to construct effective redundant stabilizer checks for single-shot error correction. Simulations show that BP decoding performs exceptionally well, even when the syndrome error rate greatly exceeds the data error rate. "

We can then construct a noncontextuality inequality and associated witness which we find to be robust against depolarising noise and loss in the form of inconclusive events. "

Yet, conventional methods of quantum state tomography are too costly in terms of their resource requirements. Classical shadow (CS) algorithms based on quantum data have been proposed as a solution to address this task by substantially reducing the number of copies of quantum states required. However, the implementation of these algorithms faces a significant challenge due to the inherent noise in near-term quantum devices, leading to inaccuracies in gate operations. To address this challenge, we propose an error-mitigated classical shadow algorithm for fermionic systems. For n-qubit quantum systems, our algorithm, which employs the easily prepared initial state $|0^n\rangle\!\langle 0^n|$ assumed to be noiseless, provably efficiently estimates all elements of $k$-RDMs with $O(kn^k\ln n)$ scaled copies of quantum states and $O(\sqrt{n}\ln^2 n)$ scaled calibration measurements. It does so even in the presence of gate or measurement noise such as depolarizing, amplitude damping, or $X$-rotation noise with at most a constant noise strength. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits scaling comparable to previous CS algorithms for fermionic systems with respect to the number of quantum state copies, while also demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in the presence of these noise sources, as well as its performance under Gaussian unitary noise. Our results underscore the potential utility of implementing our algorithm on near-term quantum devices. "

It is assumed that each accessible variable can be seen as a function of a specific inaccessible variable. Another assumption is that there exist two maximal accessible decision processes in the given situation. Two basic assumptions behind the Born rule are 1) the likelihood principle, 2) the actor in question has motivations that can be modeled by a hypothetical perfectly rational higher being.

Based on the different stages of the quantum internet and use-case in the commercialization of quantum communication, our framework classifies quantum cryptographic functionalities and the various protocol designs implementing these functionalities. Towards this classification, we introduce a novel concept of resource visualization for quantum protocols, which includes two interfaces: one to identify the building blocks for implementing a given protocol and another to identify accessible protocols when certain physical resources or functionalities are available. Such classification provides a hierarchy of quantum protocols based on their use-case and resource allocation. We have identified various valuable tools to improve its representation with a range of techniques, from abstract cryptography to graphical visualizations of the resource hierarchy in quantum networks. We elucidate the structure of the zoo and its primary features in this article to a broader class of quantum information scientists, physicists, computer science theorists and end-users.

In this regard, the D-Wave annealers have been used, while providing guidelines for optimality on certain platform-specific concerns. For evaluation purposes, a metric termed Occurrence Ratio (OR) has been defined. With minimal hyperparameter tuning, the expected solutions were obtained for every test case and the optimality was guaranteed.

Tubman",New submissions,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el),"The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising algorithm for demonstrating quantum advantage in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, optimizing VQE from random initial starting parameters is challenging due to a variety of issues including barren plateaus, optimization in the presence of noise, and slow convergence. While simulating quantum circuits classically is generically difficult, classical computing methods have been developed extensively, and powerful tools now exist to approximately simulate quantum circuits. This opens up various strategies that limit the amount of optimization that needs to be performed on quantum hardware. Here we present and benchmark an approach where we find good starting parameters for parameterized quantum circuits by classically simulating VQE by approximating the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) as a matrix product state (MPS) with a limited bond dimension. Calling this approach the variational tensor network eigensolver (VTNE), we apply it to the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard model with system sizes that use up to 32 qubits. We find that in 1D, VTNE can find parameters for PQC whose energy error is within 0.5% relative to the ground state. In 2D, the parameters that VTNE finds have significantly lower energy than their starting configurations, and we show that starting VQE from these parameters requires non-trivially fewer operations to come down to a given energy. The higher the bond dimension we use in VTNE, the less work needs to be done in VQE. By generating classically optimized parameters as the initialization for the quantum circuit one can alleviate many of the challenges that plague VQE on quantum computers. "

The syndrome extraction circuits avoid bidirectional hook errors, so we can achieve full code distance by choosing appropriate boundary conditions. We also construct variants of the syndrome extraction circuits that entirely prevent hook errors, at the cost of larger circuit depth. This achieves full distance regardless of boundary conditions, with only a modest decrease in the threshold. Furthermore, we propose an efficient strategy for dealing with dead components (qubits and measurements) in our surface code realization, which can be adopted more generally for other surface code realizations. This new surface code realization is highly optimized for Majorana-based hardware, accounting for constraints imposed by layouts and the implementation of measurements, making it competitive with the recently proposed Floquet codes.

So far, such third-order nonlinearities have been primarily achieved with circuits of concatenated Josephson tunnel junctions. In this work, we theoretically develop an alternative approach to realize third-order nonlinearities from gate-tunable and intrinsically symmetry-broken quantum material Josephson junctions. We illustrate this approach on two examples, an Andreev interferometer and a magnetic Josephson junction. Our results show that both setups enable Kerr-free three-wave mixing for a broad range of frequencies, an attribute that is highly desirable for amplifier applications. Moreover, we also find that the magnetic junction constitutes a paradigmatic example for three-wave mixing in a minimal single-junction device without the need for any external biases. We hope that our work will guide the search of dissipationless nonlinearities in quantum material superconducting devices and inspire new ways of characterizing symmetry-breaking in quantum materials with microwave techniques.

Not only do cold-atom quantum simulators hold the potential to provide new insights into outstanding high-energy and nuclear-physics questions, they also provide a versatile tool for the exploration of topological phases and ergodicity-breaking mechanisms relevant to low-energy many-body physics. In recent years, cold-atom quantum simulators have demonstrated impressive progress in the large-scale implementation of $1+1$D Abelian gauge theories. In this Review, we chronicle the progress of cold-atom quantum simulators of gauge theories, highlighting the crucial advancements achieved along the way in order to reliably stabilize gauge invariance and go from building blocks to large-scale realizations where \textit{bona fide} gauge-theory phenomena can be probed. We also provide a brief outlook on where this field is heading, and what is required experimentally and theoretically to bring the technology to the next level by surveying various concrete proposals for advancing these setups to higher spatial dimensions, higher-spin representations of the gauge field, and non-Abelian gauge groups.

Exploring its effect on the far-from-equilibrium criticality of quantum many-body systems is of great interest both from a fundamental and technological point of view. Here, we employ large-scale uniform matrix product state calculations to show that a qualitative change in the type of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) accompanies the confinement-deconfinement transition in three paradigmatic models -- the power-law interacting quantum Ising chain, the two-dimensional quantum Ising model, and the spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model. By tuning a confining parameter in these models, it is found that \textit{branch} (\textit{manifold}) DQPTs arise as a signature of (de)confinement. Whereas manifold DQPTs are associated with a sign change of the order parameter, their branch counterparts are not, but rather occur even when the order parameter exhibits considerably constrained dynamics. Our conclusions can be tested in modern quantum-simulation platforms, such as ion-trap setups and cold-atom experiments of gauge theories. "

Time flows at unequal rates at different locations. The rate at which time flows, and the causal structure it provides, may be required to have a classical description in order for quantum theory to be well-formulated.

For the transverse field Ising model with open boundaries, the local operator $\sigma^{x}$ shows an interesting picture of the ground state OTOC where the local information gets scrambled throughout the entire system and, more strikingly, starts `unscrambling' upon reflection at the other end. Earlier discussions of OTOCs did not explain the physical processes responsible for such scrambling and unscrambling of information. We explicitly show that in the paramagnetic phase, the scrambling and unscrambling is due to the scattering of a pair of low-energy spin-flip excitations, even in the presence of small interactions. In the ferromagnetic phase the same phenomena are explained by the motion of a domain-wall excitation. Thus, in different limits of the system parameters, we have provided a simple and almost complete understanding of the space-time pictures of the OTOCs, including the unscrambling, in terms of the low-energy excitations like one and two spin-flips or a single domain wall.

The other is that the excess of pseudo entropy over entanglement entropy can be positive in holographic CFTs, whereas it is always non-positive in free Dirac fermion CFTs. We argue that the entropy excess can serve as a measure of multi-partite entanglement. Its positivity implies that the vacuum state in holographic CFTs possesses multi-partite entanglement, in contrast to free Dirac fermion CFTs. "

Interestingly, many of these challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization, or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors. The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics.

Topology-changing quenches display non-analytical temporal behavior of return rates (logarithm of the Loschmidt echo) for the non-Hermitian SSH Hamiltonian in the trivial, M${\""o}$bius and topological phase.

The TCH model undergoes a dissipative transition from normal to superradiant phase hosting a gapped Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes. However, in a large region of the phase diagram, the instability of the Goldstone mode leads to the disappearance of the stable superradiant phase. In this regime, the decorrelator dynamics reveals light cone spreading of the perturbations and positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating enhanced fluctuations. Remarkably, a quasi-steady state emerges under quench dynamics in this unstable regime; in this state, a class of collective quantities such as site averaged photon number and atomic excitations approach a steady value, in spite of large temporal fluctuations in corresponding microscopic variables. This quasi-steady state describes an incoherent fluid of photons with significant phase fluctuation. The phase space dynamics reveals a fascinating ergodic behavior in presence of dissipation, leading to the characterization of the dynamical variables into two distinct classes. The first class includes site-averaged photon numbers and atomic excitations; these exhibit a stationary distribution regardless of the initial condition indicating ergodic behavior. The second class of variables, particularly those related to phase in contrast, retain information about the initial conditions, resulting in a violation of ergodicity for finite size system. Additionally, the dynamical variables of the ergodic class exhibit fascinating collective scarring phenomenon as the peak of their distribution is attracted towards the unstable steady state, analogous to the single particle quantum scar.

In this paper, We investigate the scales at which quantum gravitational corrections can be detected in a black hole using information theory. This is done by calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence for the probability distributions obtained from the Parikh-Wilczek formalism. We observe that the quantum gravitational corrections increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence as the mass of the black hole decreases, which is expected as quantum gravitational corrections can be neglected for larger black holes. However, we further observe that after a certain critical value, quantum gravitational corrections tend to decrease again as the mass of the black hole decreases. To understand the reason behind this behavior, we explicitly obtain Fisher information about such quantum gravitational corrections and find that it also increases as the mass decreases, but again, after a critical value, it decreases. This is because at such a scale, quantum fluctuations dominate the system and we lose information about the system. We obtain these results for higher-dimensional black holes and observe this behavior for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information depending on the dimensions of the black hole. These results can quantify the scale dependence and dimension dependence of the difficulty in detecting quantum gravitational corrections. "

A prominent example is the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in which a Hall voltage arises in the absence of an applied magnetic field. The AHE requires a coexistence of Berry curvature and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. These conditions can be realized in two-dimensional moir\'e systems with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry ($C_{2z}$) that host flat electronic bands. Here, we explore helical trilayer graphene (HTG), three graphene layers twisted sequentially by the same angle forming two misoriented moir\'e patterns. Although HTG is globally $C_{2z}$-symmetric, surprisingly we observe clear signatures of topological bands. At a magic angle $\theta_\mathrm{m}\approx 1.8^\circ$, we uncover a robust phase diagram of correlated and magnetic states using magnetotransport measurements. Lattice relaxation leads to large periodic domains in which $C_{2z}$ is broken on the moir\'e scale. Each domain harbors flat topological bands with valley-contrasting Chern numbers $\pm(1,-2)$. We find correlated states at integer electron fillings per moir\'e unit cell $\nu=1,2,3$ and fractional fillings $2/3,7/2$ with the AHE arising at $\nu=1,3$ and $2/3,7/2$. At $\nu=1$, a time-reversal symmetric phase appears beyond a critical electric displacement field, indicating a topological phase transition. Finally, hysteresis upon sweeping $\nu$ points to first-order phase transitions across a spatial mosaic of Chern domains separated by a network of topological gapless edge states. We establish HTG as an important platform that realizes ideal conditions for exploring strongly interacting topological phases and, due to its emergent moir\'e-scale symmetries, demonstrates a novel way to engineer topology.

While a monolayer exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic order with three possible ordering wave vectors, a rich phase diagram is obtained for moir\'e superlattices as a function of interlayer exchange and twist angle. For large twist angles, each layer spontaneously picks a single zigzag ordering wave vector, whereas, for small twist angles, the ground state involves a combination of all three wave vectors in a complex hexagonal domain structure. This multi-domain order minimizes the interlayer energy while enduring the energy cost due to the domain wall formation. Our results indicate that magnetic frustration due to stacking-dependent interlayer exchange in moir\'e superlattices can be used to tune the magnetic ground state and enhance quantum fluctuations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Within our adiabatic formalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined in synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic description of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by singularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures.

We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the superfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson junctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological invariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the normal phase band structure. These topological effects can be equivalently viewed as manifestations of chiral anomaly. Our predictions are experimentally testable in graphene-superconductor hybrids. "

Barajas-Aguilar, Jasen Zion, Ian Sequeira, Andrew Z. Barabas, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Eric Barrett, Thomas Scaffidi, Javier D. Sanchez-Yamagishi",New submissions,Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall),"In graphene devices, the electronic drift velocity can easily exceed the speed of sound in the material at moderate current biases. Under this condition, the electronic system can efficiently amplify acoustic phonons, leading to the exponential growth of sound waves in the direction of the carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate that such phonon amplification can significantly modify the electrical properties of graphene devices. We observe a super-linear growth of the resistivity in the direction of the carrier flow when the drift velocity exceeds the speed of sound, causing up to a 7 times increase over 8 micrometers. The resistance growth is observable for carrier densities away from the Dirac point and is enhanced at cryogenic temperatures. These observations are explained by a theoretical model for the electrical-amplification of acoustic phonons, which reach frequencies up to 2.2 terahertz with the nanoscale wavelength set by gate-tunable ~kF transitions across the Fermi surface. These findings offer a route to high-frequency on-chip sound generation and detection, which can be used to modulate and probe electronic physics in van der Waals heterostructures in the terahertz frequency range.

Farrell, Aaron J. Friedman, Isabella Zane, Paolo Glorioso, Andrew Lucas",New submissions,Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"The past decade has witnessed the development of systematic effective theories for dissipative thermal systems. Here, we describe an analogous effective theory framework that applies to the classical stochastic dynamics of nonequilibrium systems. We illustrate this approach using a range of examples, including nonreciprocal (predator-prey) dynamics, dissipative and driven rigid-body motion, and active chiral fluids and solids. Many of these systems exhibit a generalized time-reversal symmetry, which plays a crucial role within our formalism, and in many cases can be implemented within the Martin-Siggia-Rose path integral. This effective theory formalism yields generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and second law of thermodynamics valid out of equilibrium. By stipulating a stationary distribution and a set of symmetries -- rather than postulating the stochastic equations of motion directly -- this formalism provides an alternative route to building phenomenological models of driven and active matter. We hope that this approach facilitates a systematic investigation of the universality classes of active matter, and provides a common language for nonequilibrium many-body physics from high energy to condensed matter.

The influence of the crystallographic structure of Fe, its thickness, and the presence of other layers above and below the Fe layer on magnetic parameters, such as the MAE of the studied system, is an intriguing and important topic from an application point of view. Here, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the magnetic anisotropy of nine-monolayer Fe, FeCo, and FeCo films with B, C, and N dopants placed in octahedral interstitial positions. The theoretical study is based on calculations using the full-potential local-orbital code FPLO and the generalized gradient approximation. The chemical disorder in the FeCo layers was modeled using the virtual crystal approximation. The structures of the layers were subjected to optimization of the geometry of the interlayer spacings and the neighborhood of the dopant sites. We determined the local magnetic moments and the excess charge at each layer position. We also identified the influence of dopant atoms on the magnetic properties of FeCo layers, such as magnetization and magnetic anisotropy. "

In this work, we study a two-orbital Hubbard model with one strongly correlated $3d$ orbital and one more itinerant $5d$ orbital, by using an eight-site cellular dynamic mean field theory study. We establish a superconducting phase diagram with $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$, $s_{\pm}$ and $d+is$ wave pairing symmetries, based on which we clarify the roles of various relevant parameters including hybridization $V$, itinerant carrier density $\langle n_{c}\rangle$ and interaction $U_{c}$. We show that the inclusion of a less correlated $5d$ band in general suppresses the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ wave pairing. We demonstrate that the $d+is$ wave is maximized when the $5d$ orbital has a large Coulomb repulsion with intermediate hybridization parameter. We perform fluctuation diagnostics to show that the driving force behind the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ wave is the intraband antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the $3d$ orbital, while for the $s_{\pm}$ wave, the pairing is mainly from the antiferromagnetic correlations residing on the local $3d$-$5d$ bond in real space.

We illustrate that for a wide class of gapless states that can be associated with fully-isolated scale invariant fixed points, there shall always be emergent continuous symmetries that are directly related to smooth deformations of gapped states with symmetries lower than the protecting ones $G_p$. For a 3D TQCP in DIII classes with $G_p=Z^T_2$, $U_{EM}=U(1)$ and $N_f=\frac{1}{2}$ fermions but without charge $U(1)$ symmetry, we explicitly construct a corresponding boundary representation based on a $4D$ topological state with lattice symmetry $H=Z^T_2 \ltimes U(1)$ and $N_f={1}$ fermions. Although emergent continuous symmetries appear to be robust at weakly interacting TQCPs, we further show the breakdown of such one-to-one correspondence between deformations of gapped states and emergent continuous symmetries when gapless states become strongly interacting. In a strongly interacting limit, gapless states can be represented by a smooth manifold of conformal-field-theory fixed points rather than a fully isolated one. A smooth manifold of strong coupling fixed points hinders emergence of a continuous emergent symmetry in the strongly interacting gapless limit, as deformations no longer leave a gapless state or a TQCP invariant, unlike in the more conventional weakly interacting case. This typically reduces continuous emergent symmetries to a discrete symmetry originating from duality transformations under the protection symmetry $G_p$. "

Theoretical insights have long been hindered due to the lack of an accurate first-principles description of the lattice dynamics of cuprates. Recently, using the r2SCAN meta-GGA functional, we were able to achieve accurate phonon spectra of an insulating cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$, and discover significant magnetoelastic coupling in experimentally interesting Cu-O bond stretching optical modes [Phys. Rev. B 107, 045126 (2023)]. We extend this work by comparing PBE and r2SCAN performances with corrections from the on-site Hubbard U and the D4 van der Waals (vdW) methods, aiming at further understanding on both the materials science side and the density functional side. We demonstrate the importance of vdW and self-interaction corrections for accurate first-principles YBa2 Cu3 O6 lattice dynamics. Since r2SCAN by itself partially accounts for these effects, the good performance of r2SCAN is now more fully explained. In addition, the performances of the Tao-Mo series of meta-GGAs, which are constructed in a different way from SCAN/r2SCAN, are also compared and discussed. "

To reveal the connection between the macroscopic relaxation properties and the underlying dynamics, the one-dimensional diatomic hard-point model as an illustrating example was studied analytically and numerically. We demonstrate how the system transitions from kinetic behavior to hydrodynamic behavior as the nonintegrability strength increases. Specifically, for the thermalization dynamics, we find a power-law relationship between the thermalization time and the perturbation strength near integrable regime, whereas in the far from integrable regime, the hydrodynamics dominates and the thermalization time becomes independent of the perturbation strength and exhibits a strong size-dependent behavior. Regarding transport behavior, our results further establish a threshold for the nonintegrable strength of this transition. Consequently, we can predict which behavior dominates the transport properties of the system. Especially, an explicit expression of the thermal conductivity contributed by the kinetics is given. Finally, possible applications were briefly discussed. "

Theoretically, RDF expressions for odd-dimensional fluids can be obtained by solving the Percus-Yevick integral equations. But for even-dimensional cases, such as the hard disk (2D) fluid, analytical expressions are infeasible. The only 2D RDF is a heuristic expression proposed by Yuste et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 99, 2020,1993), which approximates the 2D RDF with an interpolation of the RDFs for hard-rod (1D) and hard-sphere (3D) fluids and provides acceptable estimations for an intermediate and low density range. In this work, we employ a simple and empirical expression for the 2D RDF and the 3D RDF based on the approach proposed by Trokhymchuk et al. for the 3D RDF (J. Chem. Phys., 123, 024501, 2005). The parameters are determined in such a way that the final RDF expressions are thermodynamically consistent, namely the pressure constraint and the isothermal compressibility constraint are both satisfied. The new RDFs for the 2D and 3D hard spheres are highly accurate for the entire density range up to the first-order phase transition points. The predictions of the first coordination numbers are consistent with simulation results for 3D fluid. Finally, by using the 2D RDF with a primitive second-order perturbation theory, the pressure-volume-temperature relation and vapor-liquid equilibrium are calculated for the 2D Lennard-Jones fluid. Comparisons with the simulation data show promising results. "

Larson, Louis Sharma, Stephen Carr, Efthimios Kaxiras",New submissions,Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall),"An accurate description of the low-energy electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) is of great interest due to their relation to correlated electron phases, such as superconductivity and Mott-insulator behavior at half-filling. The paradigmatic model of Bistritzer and MacDonald [PNAS 108, 12233 (2011)], based on the moir\'e pattern formed by tBLG, predicts the existence of ""magic angles"" at which the Fermi velocity of the low-energy bands goes to zero, and the bands themselves become dispersionless. Here, we reexamine the low-energy bands of tBLG from the ab initio electronic structure perspective, motivated by features related to the atomic relaxation in the moir\'e pattern, namely circular regions of AA stacking, triangular regions of AB/BA stacking and domain walls separating the latter. We find that the bands are never perfectly flat and the Fermi velocity never vanishes, but rather a ""magic range"" exists where the lower band becomes extremely flat and the Fermi velocity attains a non-zero minimum value. We propose a simple $(2+2)$-band model, comprised of two different pairs of orbitals, both on a honeycomb lattice: the first pair represents the low-energy bands with high localization at the AA sites, while the second pair represents highly dispersive bands associated with domain-wall states. This model gives an accurate description of the low-energy bands with few (13) parameters which are physically motivated and vary smoothly in the magic range. In addition, we derive an effective two-band hamiltonian which also gives an accurate description of the low-energy bands. This minimal two-band model affords a connection to a Hubbard-like description of the occupancy of sub-bands and can be used a basis for exploring correlated states. "

We examine the properties of these states using the Fu-Kane-Mele Hamiltonian in presence of a magnetic exchange field. The corresponding spin textures of surface states, which are well reproduced by an effective two-band model, hint at a considerable enhancement of the lifetime of out-of-plane spins compared to in-plane spins. This is confirmed by large-scale spin transport simulations for 3D MTIs with disorder. The energy dependence of the spin lifetime anisotropy arises directly from the nontrivial spin texture of the surface states, and is correlated with the onset of the quantum anomalous Hall phase. Our findings suggest novel spin filtering capabilities of the gapped surface MTI states, which could be explored by Hanle spin precession measurements. "

Here the intrinsic correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving {\it the spin excitation}, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp scattering mediated by {\it the same spin excitation}. This {\it same spin excitation} that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.

Narra",New submissions,Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),"Previous work on additively-manufactured oxide dispersion strengthened alloys focused on experimental approaches, resulting in larger dispersoid sizes and lower number densities than can be achieved with conventional powder metallurgy. To improve the as-fabricated microstructure, this work integrates experiments with a thermodynamic and kinetic modeling framework to probe the limits of the dispersoid sizes and number densities that can be achieved with powder bed fusion-laser beam. Bulk samples of a Ni-20Cr $+$ 1 wt.\% Y$_2$O$_3$ alloy are fabricated using a range of laser power and scanning velocity combinations. Scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization is performed to quantify the dispersoid size distributions across the processing space. The smallest mean dispersoid diameter (29 nm) is observed at 300 W and 1200 mm/s, with a number density of 1.0$\times$10$^{20}$ m$^{-3}$. The largest mean diameter (72 nm) is observed at 200 W and 200 mm/s, with a number density of 1.5$\times$10$^{19}$ m$^{-3}$. Scanning electron microscopy suggests that a considerable fraction of the oxide added to the feedstock is lost during processing, due to oxide agglomeration and the ejection of oxide-rich spatter from the melt pool. After accounting for these losses, the model predictions for the dispersoid diameter and number density align with the experimental trends. The results suggest that rapid coarsening of dispersoids in the melt pool limits the final number density to less than 10$^{21}$ m$^{-3}$, which is more than 100 times lower than that achievable with powder metallurgy. The modeling framework is leveraged to propose processing strategies to limit dispersoid size and increase number density. "

In semiconductor films (heterostructures), quantum well (QW) states arise due to electron/hole accumulations at the surface (interface). The quantized states due to quantum confinement can be observed by VUV-ARPES, while the periodic intensity modulations along the surface normal (kz) direction of these quantized states are also observable by varying incident photon energy, resembling three-dimensional (3D) band dispersion. We have conducted soft X-ray (SX) ARPES measurements on thick and ultrathin III-V semiconductor InSb(001) films to investigate the electronic dimensionality reduction in semiconductor QWs. In addition to the dissipation of the kz dispersion, the SX-ARPES observations demonstrate the changes of the symmetry and periodicity of the Brillouin zone in the ultrathin film as 2D QW compared with these of the 3D bulk one, indicating the electronic dimensionality reduction of the 3D bulk band dispersion caused by the quantum confinement.

The method is based on the use of composition-gradient films deposited by combinatorial sputtering. This structure allows the fabrication of devices with different compositions on a single substrate, drastically enhancing the throughput in investigating composition dependence. We fabricated CPP-GMR devices on a single GMR film consisting of a Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ (0 $\le$ $\textit{x}$ $\le$ 1) composition-gradient layer, a Cu spacer layer, and a NiFe layer. The MR ratio obtained from resistance-field measurements exhibited the maximum in the broad Co concentration range of 0.3 $\le$ $\textit{x}$ $\le$ 0.65. In addition, the STT efficiency was estimated from the current to induce magnetization reversal of the NiFe layer by spin injection from the Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ layer. The STT efficiency was also the highest around the same Co concentration range as for the MR ratio, and this correlation was theoretically explained by the change in the spin polarization of the Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ layer. The results revealed the Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$ composition range suitable for spintronic applications, demonstrating the advantages of the developed method. "

They are found in a variety of natural systems, such as biological tissues, and artificial materials such as suspensions of self-propelled colloidal particles or synthetic microswimmers. Active nematics have attracted significant attention in recent years because of their spectacular nonequilibrium collective spatiotemporal dynamics, which may enable applications in fields such as robotics, drug delivery, and materials science. The orientation field, which measures the direction and degree of alignment of the local nematic director, is a crucial characteristic of an active nematic and is essential for detecting and studying topological defects. However, determining the orientation field is a significant challenge in many experimental systems. Although orientation fields can be derived from images of active nematics using traditional imaging processing methods, the results and accuracy of such methods are highly sensitive to the settings of the algorithm. These settings must be tuned from image-to-image due to experimental noise, intrinsic noise of the imaging technology, and perturbations caused by changes in experimental conditions. This sensitivity currently limits the automatic analysis of active nematics. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a machine learning model for extracting reliable orientation fields from raw experimental images, which enables accurate automatic analysis of topological defects. Application of the algorithm to experimental data demonstrates that the approach is robust and highly generalizable to experimental settings that were unseen in the training data. These results suggest that it will be a useful tool for investigating active nematics, and the approach may be generalized to other active matter systems. "

We show that the conventional approach based on extensions of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula for the oscillation amplitudes becomes inapplicable when the correlation length exceeds the cyclotron radius. This breakdown is due to (i) non-analytic finite-temperature contributions to the fermion self-energy (ii) an enhancement of the oscillatory part of the self-energy by quantum fluctuations, and (iii) non-trivial dynamical scaling laws associated with the quantum critical point. We properly incorporate these effects within the Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg framework for the thermodynamic potential by treating the fermionic and bosonic contributions on equal footing. As a result, we obtain the modified expressions for the oscillations of entropy and magnetization that remain valid in the non-Fermi liquid regime. "

The influence of epitaxial strain on the magnetic properties of manganite films is measured using macroscopic magnetization measurements and shown mixed reports suggesting, both, an increase and decrease in ferromagnetic phases on the application of the strain. Using polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR), a simultaneous measurement of transport and magnetic properties of manganite thin films showed direct evidence of modification in the magnetic properties on the application of bending strain. The coupling coefficient of strain and magnetism of manganite heterostructures was estimated using PNR, which not only helped to understand the correlation of elastic strain with magnetism but also explained the condition of magnetic phase order change in the phase-separated systems within a phenomenological Ginzburg Landau theory. An overview is also provided of the current perspectives and existing studies on the influence of strain on structure, electronic, magnetic, magnetic anisotropy, phase coexistence and magnetocaloric properties of mixed valence manganite heterostructures. Based on the understanding of a diverse range of perovskite functionalities, detailed perspectives on how the coupling of strain and magnetism open up pathways toward the emergence of novel device design features including the different ways of applying uniform strain, are discussed.

Tribello",New submissions,Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),"The accurate description of the structural and thermodynamic properties of ferroelectrics has been one of the most remarkable achievements of Density Functional Theory (DFT). However, running large simulation cells with DFT is computationally demanding, while simulations of small cells are often plagued with non-physical effects that are a consequence of the system's finite size. Therefore, one is often forced to use empirical models that describe the physics of the material in terms of effective interaction terms, that are fitted using the results from DFT, to perform simulations that do not suffer from finite size effects. In this study we use a machine-learning (ML) potential trained on DFT, in combination with accelerated sampling techniques, to converge the thermodynamic properties of Barium Titanate (BTO) with first-principles accuracy and a full atomistic description. Our results indicate that the predicted Curie temperature depends strongly on the choice of DFT functional and system size, due to the presence of emergent long-range directional correlations in the local dipole fluctuations.

For bulk and uniformly doped diamond samples, the infrared optical spectroscopy successfully performs such a role. Here we propose a correct method to determine the boron concentration in CVD homoepitaxial diamond layers from FTIR spectra. The method is the natural advancement of the existing technique for bulk samples. The feature of the novel technique is the accurate accounting of passing radiation through a multilayered structure with different thicknesses of absorbing media for special absorbing mechanisms. For this situation, an expression for the effective optical density is obtained. We have demonstrated the benefit of the method for a set of samples with CVD homoepitaxial layers grown on various HPHT substrates with and without nitrogen impurity. The measured FTIR spectra were subdivided into relevant sections responsible for the specific absorption mechanisms, and the correct amplitudes of the boron absorption peaks were derived. The data obtained from FTIR spectra is thoroughly compared to the charge carrier concentration derived from electrical capacitance-voltage measurements. "

The force field enables large-scale dynamic simulations of dry and lubricated tribological contacts and is tailored to surfaces with hydrogen, hydroxyl and aromatic surface passivation. To favour its compatibility with existing force-field parameterizations for liquids and allow a straightforward extension to other types of surface passivation species, we adopt the commonly used OPLS functional form. The optimisation of the force-field parameters is systematic and follows a protocol that can be reused for other surface-molecule combinations. Reference data are calculated with gradient- and dispersion-corrected density functional theory and include the bonding structure and elastic deformation of bulk and surface structures as well as surface adhesion and water adsorption energy landscapes. The conventions adopted to define the different force-field atom types are based on the hybridisation of carbon orbitals and enable a simple and efficient parameter optimisation strategy based on quantum-mechanical calculations performed only on crystalline reference structures. Transferability tests on amorphous interfaces demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. After testing the force field, we present two examples of application to tribological problems. Namely, we investigate relationships between dry friction and the corrugation of the contact potential energy surface and the dependency of friction on the thickness of interface water films. We finally discuss the limitations of the force field and propose strategies for its improvement and extension. "

We conclude by discussing how to incorporate numerical exactness within inverse renormalization group approaches of disordered systems, thus opening up the opportunity to explore a sustainable and energy-efficient generation of exact configurations for increasing lattice volumes without the use of dedicated supercomputers.

Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) are the ideal class of materials for the realization of such devices. Their ferroelectric character enables an electronic control of the Rashba-type spin texture by means of the reversible and switchable polarization. Yet, only very few materials have been established to belong to this class of multifunctional materials. Here, Pb1-xGexTe is unraveled as a novel FERSC system down to nanoscale. The ferroelectric phase transition and concomitant lattice distortion is demonstrated by temperature dependent X-ray diffraction, and its effect on electronic properties are measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In few nanometer-thick epitaxial heterostructures, a large Rashba spin-splitting is exhibiting a wide tuning range as a function of temperature and Ge content.

These interactions can be rigorously modeled through microscopic calculations. However, these calculations can be computationally intensive and often lack physical insights. An alternative is to use phenomenological many-body interaction models such as the modified optical Bloch equations (MOBEs) and the anharmonic oscillator (AO) model. While both these models have separately been used to interpret experimental data, to the best of our knowledge, an explicit and direct correspondence between these models has not been established. Here, we show the empirical equivalence between these two complimentary MBI models through two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy simulations. A quantitative correspondence between the MBI parameters used in the two models are obtained. We also perform a quantitative comparison of these MBI models with experiments, which highlights the usefulness of these phenomenological models in interpreting experimental results. "

We find that the Ni doping shifts the valence band (VB) of pristine SrTiO$_3$ towards the Fermi level (p-doping) and reduces its band gap. This is accompanied by an upward energy shift of the Ti t2g-derived mobile electron system (MES). Thereby, the in-plane dxy-derived bands reduce the embedded electron density, as evidenced by progressive reduction of their Fermi momentum with the Ni concentration, and the out-of-plane dxz/yz-derived bands depopulate, making the MES purely two-dimensional. Furthermore, the Ti and Ni L2,3-edge resonant photoemission is used to identify the Ni 3d impurity state in the vicinity of the valence-band maximum, and decipher the full spectrum of the VO-induced in-gap states originating from the Ni atoms, Ti atoms, and from their hybridized orbitals.

Lee, Gabriel Kotliar, Jan von Delft",New submissions,Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el),"We study paramagnetic quantum criticality in the periodic Anderson model (PAM) using cellular dynamical mean-field theory, with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) as an impurity solver. The PAM describes an itinerant $c$ band hybridizing with a localized $f$ band. At $T=0$, it exhibits a hybridization tuned Kondo breakdown quantum critical point (KB-QCP) from a Kondo to an RKKY phase. At the KB-QCP, the $f$ band changes character from itinerant to mainly localized, while the $c$ band remains itinerant. We elucidate its nature in detail by performing a high-resolution, real-frequency study of dynamical quantities. NRG allows us to study the quantum critical non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) regime located between $T_{FL}<T_{NFL}$. Surprisingly, self-consistency is essential to stabilize the NFL and the QCP. The Fermi-liquid (FL) scale $T_{FL}$ decreases towards and vanishes at the QCP. At $T=0$, we find the following properties. The $f$ quasiparticle (QP) weight $Z_f$ decreases continuously as the QCP is approached from either side, vanishing only at the QCP. Therefore, $Z_f$ is nonzero in both the Kondo and the RKKY phase; hence, the FL QP comprise $c$ and $f$ electrons in both phases. The Fermi surface (FS) volumes in the two phases differ. Whereas the large-FS Kondo phase has a usual two-band structure, the small-FS RKKY phase has an unexpected three-band structure. We provide a detailed analysis of quasiparticle properties of both the Kondo and the RKKY phase. The FS reconstruction is accompanied by the appearance of a Luttinger surface (LS) on which the $f$ self-energy diverges. The FS and LS volumes are related to the density by a generalized Luttinger sum rule. We interpret the small FS volume and the emergent LS as evidence for $f$-electron fractionalization in the RKKY phase. Our Hall coefficient and specific heat are in good qualitative agreement with experiment. "

In the first part, we derive a unified speed limit inequality for a general weighted graph, which reproduces both the conventional speed limit inequality and the trade-off relation between current and entropy production as its special case. In the second part, we treat the setting where the tightest bound with the Wasserstein distance has not yet been obtained and investigate why such a bound is out of reach. In the third part, we compare the speed limit inequalities for Markov jump processes with L$^1$-Wasserstein distance and for overdamped Langevin systems with L$^2$-Wasserstein distance, and argue that these two have different origins despite their apparent similarity.

Charge transport in these materials is the result of a compromise between confinement at the individual QD level and electronic coupling among the different nanocrystals in the ensemble. While this is commonly achieved by ligand engineering in colloidal-based systems, ligand-free QD assemblies have recently emerged as an exciting alternative where nanostructures can be directly grown into porous matrices with optical quality as well as control over their connectivity and hence charge transport properties. In this context, we present a complete photophysical study comprising fluence and temperature-dependent time-resolved spectroscopy to study carrier dynamics in ligand-free QD networks with gradually varying degrees of interconnectivity, which we achieve by changing the average distance between the QDs. Analysis of the photoluminescence and absorption properties of the QD assemblies, involving both static and time-resolved measurements, allows us to identify the weight of the different recombination mechanisms, both radiative and non-radiative, as a function of QD connectivity. We propose a picture where carrier diffusion, which is needed for any optoelectronic application and implies inter-particle transport, gives rise to the exposure of carriers to a larger defect landscape than in the case of isolated QDs. The use of a broad range of fluences permits extracting valuable information for applications demanding either low or high carrier injection levels and highlighting the relevance of a judicious design to balance recombination and diffusion.

This weak pinning manifests itself in a saturated width of the domain wall position fluctuations that increases sublinearly with the system size. As a function of time $t$ and system size $L$, the width $w(t,L)$ exhibits a scaling behavior $w(t,L)=L^{3/4}f(t/L^{9/4})$, with $f(u)$ constant for $u\gg1$ and $f(u)\sim u^{1/3}$ for $u\ll1$. An Orstein-Uhlenbeck process with long-range anticorrelated noise is shown to capture this scaling behavior. Results for the drift coefficient of the domain wall motion point to memory effects in its dynamics. "

This setup is akin to a step-initial configuration where the non-zero part of the step is subjected to dephasing. We investigate the quantum dynamics of local electron density, the scaling of the density front as a function of time both inside and outside of the initial step, and the growth of the total number of electrons outside the step. We analyze these quantities in all three regimes, namely, the de-localized, critical, and localized phases of the underlying lattice. Outside the initial step, we observe that the density front spreads according to the underlying nature of single-particle states of the lattice, for both the de-localized and critical phases. For the localized phase, the spread of the density front hints at a logarithmic behaviour in time that has no parallel in the isolated case (\emph{i.e.}, in the absence of probes). Inside the initial step, due to the presence of the probes, the density front spreads in a diffusive manner for all the phases. This combination of rich and different dynamical behaviour, outside and inside the initial step, results in the emergence of mixed dynamical phases. While the total occupation of electrons remains conserved, the value outside or inside the initial step turns out to have a rich dynamical behaviour. Our work is widely adaptable and has interesting consequences when disordered/quasi-disordered systems are subjected to a thermodynamically large number of probes. "

In the framework of these approaches, we establish exact conditions, that a particular point of these profiles should satisfy, in the form of contact theorems. These contact theorems for the total density profile and the charge density profile are obtained by direct integration of a system of equations derived from the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Yvon equations. The contact theorems for both profiles have nonlocal character. It is shown that the contact value of the total density profile for uncharged surfaces is characterized by the bulk pressure and the surface tension.

Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs. "

The charge density wave (CDW) state in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 in particular intrigued the community -- the CDW phase appears to break the time-reversal symmetry despite the absence of spin magnetism, which has been tied to exotic orbital loop currents possibly intertwined with magnetic field tunable crystal distortions. To test this connection, precise determination of the lattice response to applied magnetic field is crucial, but can be challenging at the atomic-scale. We establish a new scanning tunneling microscopy based method to study the evolution of the AV3Sb5 atomic structure as a function of magnetic field. The method substantially reduces the errors of typical STM measurements, which are at the order of 1% when measuring an in-plane lattice constant change. We find that the out-of-plane lattice constant of AV3Sb5 remains unchanged (within 10^-6) by the application of both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We also reveal that the in-plane lattice response to magnetic field is at most at the order of 0.05%.

While they behave as usual topological order along a preferred spatial direction, their physics along perpendicular planes is dictated by the presence of fractal subsystem symmetries, completely restricting the mobility of anyonic excitations and their bound states. We consider an explicit lattice model realization of such phases and proceed to study their properties under periodic boundary conditions and, later, in the presence of boundaries. We find that for specific lattice sizes, the system possesses line and fractal membrane symmetries that are mutually anomalous, resulting in a non-trivially gapped ground state space. This amounts to the spontaneous breaking of the fractal symmetries, implying a sub-extensive ground state degeneracy. For the remaining system sizes the fractal symmetries are explicitly broken by the periodic boundary conditions, which is intrinsically related to the uniqueness of the ground state. Despite of that, the system is still topologically ordered since locally created quasi-particles have nontrivial mutual statistics and, in the presence of boundaries, it still presents anomalous edge modes. The intricate symmetry interplay dictated by the lattice size is a wild manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. "

Through molecular dynamics simulations on a large single crystal, we elucidate the intricate process of converting plastic strain, atomic strain, and rigid rotation during irradiation. Our study highlights how prismatic dislocation loops act as initiators of plastic strain effects in heavily irradiated metals, resulting in experimentally measurable alterations in lattice strain. We show the onset of plastic strain starts to emerge at high dose, leading to the spontaneous emergence of dislocation creep and irradiation-induced lattice swelling. This phenomenon arises from the agglomeration of dislocation loops into a dislocation network. Furthermore, our numerical framework enables us to categorize the plastic transformation into two distinct types: pure slip events and slip events accompanied by lattice swelling.

We find that the flat band leads to nontrivial exotic effects. As the Fermi level enters the flat band, both the pairing gap and the in-plane superfluid density exhibit an unusual power law as a function of interaction, with strongly enhanced quantum geometric effects, in addition to a dramatic increase of compressibility as the interaction approaches the BCS limit. As the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularities, the character of pairing changes from particle-like to hole-like or vice versa. We present the computed phase diagram, in which a pair density wave state emerges at high densities with relatively strong interaction strength. "

We show that lattice relaxation results in the formation of domains of periodic single-moir\'{e} structures only for twist angles close to the simplest fractions. For the majority of other twist angles, the incommensurate moir\'{e} periods lead to a fundamentally quasicrystalline structure. We identify experimentally relevant magic angles at which the electronic density of states is sharply peaked and strongly correlated physics is most likely to be realized. "

We demonstrate, in the context of a fast harmonic oscillator forced by one component of the Lorenz 1963 model, that this principle can be used to construct time-discrete surrogate models by numerically extracting approximate locations and residues of complex poles via Adaptive Antoulas-Andersen (AAA) rational interpolation and feeding this information into the known ""connection formula"" to compute the resulting fast amplitude. Despite small but nonnegligible local errors, the surrogate model maintains excellent accuracy over very long times. In addition, we observe that the long-time behavior of fast energy offers a continuous-time analog of Gottwald and Melbourne's 2004 ""0-1 test for chaos"" - the asymptotic growth rate of the energy in the oscillator can discern whether or not the forcing function is chaotic.

First, the free energy of the interacting condensate is given in terms of an effective theory describing the probability distribution of the number of condensed particles. Second, the free energy of the thermally excited particles equals that of a temperature-dependent Bogoliubov Hamiltonian. We extend this result to a more general class of interaction potentials, including interactions with a hard core. Our proof follows a different approach than the one in arXiv:2305.19173 [math-ph]: we model microscopic correlations between the particles by a Jastrow factor, and exploit a cancellation in the computation of the energy that emerges due to the different length scales in the system.

It was noted in \cite{Jia_2020} that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the double-scaled SYK (DS-SYK) model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices.

This paper introduces a novel approach, called Edge Activation Direct Coupling Analysis (eaDCA), tailored to the characteristics of RNA sequences, with a strong emphasis on simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability. eaDCA explicitly constructs sparse coevolutionary models for RNA families, achieving performance levels comparable to more complex methods while utilizing a significantly lower number of parameters. Our approach demonstrates efficiency in generating artificial RNA sequences that closely resemble their natural counterparts in both statistical analyses and SHAPE-MaP experiments, and in predicting the effect of mutations. Notably, eaDCA provides a unique feature: estimating the number of potential functional sequences within a given RNA family. For example, in the case of cyclic di-AMP riboswitches (RF00379), our analysis suggests the existence of approximately $\mathbf{10^{39}}$ functional nucleotide sequences. While huge compared to the known $< \mathbf{4,000}$ natural sequences, this number represents only a tiny fraction of the vast pool of nearly $\mathbf{10^{82}}$ possible nucleotide sequences of the same length (136 nucleotides). These results underscore the promise of sparse and interpretable generative models, such as eaDCA, in enhancing our understanding of the expansive RNA sequence space. "

A key challenge in analyzing these equations is the fact that the collision frequencies are allowed to depend on the species temperatures, which allows for more realistic simulations of dilute gas flow. Therefore, a positive lower bound is established for the species temperatures. With this lower bound, a global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled velocity-energy ODE system is established. The lower bound also enables a proof of exponential decay to a unique steady-state solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate how the bulk velocities and temperatures relax for large times. "

In this work we study a generalization of the Chern correspondence in the context of higher gauge theory, where the structure group of the bundle is categorified. For this, we define connective structures on a multiplicative gerbe and propose a natural notion of complexification for an important class of 2-groups. Using this, we put forward a new notion of higher connection which is well-suited for describing holomorphic principal 2-bundles for these 2-groups, and establish a Chern correspondence in this way.

This paper offers a comprehensive and mathematically rigorous understanding of the dipolar resonances within the HISE structure. Firstly, the original formula for the resonant frequencies of arbitrarily shaped hard inclusions is derived explicitly for the first time. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resonances arise due to the high contrast in Lam\'e parameters between various materials, while the sub-wavelength characteristics of the resonances are attributed to the significant disparities in material densities. Furthermore, the dipolar characterization of the resonances is rigorously justified. To validate our findings, we investigate resonant phenomena within a spherical geometry, offering both an alternative method for calculating resonant frequencies and a confirmation of the results presented in this paper.

From the bifurcation analysis, we find that the temporal evolution of oscillators exhibit the transition from quasiperiodic to chaotic dynamics. This has been corroborated by the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the system. Furthermore, on investigating the correlation of the time-series using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, it is found that the chaotic system is anti-phase synchronized, whereas the quasiperiodic is not synchronized in any form. The parametric regime where this transition has been observed is from the Unbroken PT regime to the Broken PT regime. Similarly, in the latter configuration with two amplified oscillators coupled to two attenuated oscillators, a similar transition has been observed. But in the neighbourhood of the Exceptional Point (EP) of the system, the system is shown to exhibit in-phase synchronized dynamics as is evident from the correlation analysis. "

We demonstrate the use of kernel integral operators within delay coordinates as an innovative method for UPO detection. For identifying the dynamic behavior associated with each individual UPO, we utilize the Koopman operator to present the dynamics as linear equations in the space of Koopman eigenfunctions. This allows for characterizing the chaotic attractor by investigating its principal dynamical modes across varying UPOs. We extend this methodology into an interpretable machine learning framework aimed at stabilizing strange attractors on their UPOs. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we apply it to the Lorenz attractor as a case study. "

The system exhibits a rich set of behaviors depending on the balance between the natural frequency of isolated units and the self-feedback. The case of two oscillators is solved analytically, while a numerical approach is used for $N>2$. Building from Kuramoto, the approach to synchronization, when possible, is studied through a local complex order parameter.

A wealth of behaviors have been found mostly for globally coupled systems. From a complexity perspective, less studied have been systems with local coupling, which is the subject of this contribution. The phase approximation is used, as weak coupling is assumed. In particular, the so called needle region, in parameter space, for Adler-type oscillators with nearest neighbors coupling is carefully characterized. The reason for this emphasis is that in the border of this region to the surrounding chaotic one, computation enhancement at the edge of chaos has been reported. The present study shows that different behaviors within the needle region can be found, and a smooth change of dynamics could be identified. Entropic measures further emphasize the region's heterogeneous nature with interesting features, as seen in the spatiotemporal diagrams. The occurrence of wave-like patterns in the spatiotemporal diagrams points to non-trivial correlations in both dimensions. The wave patterns change as the control parameters change without exiting the needle region. Spatial correlation is only achieved locally at the onset of chaos, with different clusters of oscillators behaving coherently while disordered boundaries appear between them. "

This result also serves as an example that linear decay weaker than the classical diffusive decay, together with quadratic nonlinearity, still gives nonlinear stability of spatially periodic patterns. Linear analysis reveals that, instead of the classical $t^{-1}$ diffusive decay rate, small perturbations of roll solutions at the zigzag boundary decay with a $t^{-3/4}$ rate along with time, due to the degeneracy of the quadratic term of the continuation of the translational mode of the linearized operator in the Bloch-Fourier spaces. The nonlinear stability proof is based on a decomposition of the neutral translational mode and the faster decaying modes in the Bloch-Fourier space, and a fixed-point argument, demonstrating the irrelevancy of the nonlinear terms.

Modeling these systems is made challenging by the number and variety of biological components and interactions (from molecules in gene regulatory networks to species in ecological networks) and the often-incomplete state of system knowledge (e.g., the unknown values of kinetic parameters for biochemical reactions). Boolean networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling these systems. We provide a methodological overview of Boolean network models of biological systems. After a brief introduction, we describe the process of building, analyzing, and validating a Boolean model. We then present the use of the model to make predictions about the system's response to perturbations and about how to control (or at least influence) its behavior. We emphasize the interplay between structural and dynamical properties of Boolean networks and illustrate them in three case studies from disparate levels of biological organization. "

Obtaining robust results in any algorithm is strongly dependent on how to balance between these two modes. Whale optimization algorithm as a robust and well recognized metaheuristic algorithm in the literature, has proposed a novel scheme to achieve this balance. It has also shown superior results on a wide range of applications. Moreover, in the previous chapter, an equitable and fair performance evaluation of the algorithm was provided. However, to this point, only comparison of the final results is considered, which does not explain how these results are obtained. Therefore, this chapter attempts to empirically analyze the WOA algorithm in terms of the local and global search capabilities i.e. the ratio of exploration and exploitation phases. To achieve this objective, the dimension-wise diversity measurement is employed, which, at various stages of the optimization process, statistically evaluates the population's convergence and diversity.

As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies advance, they will provide unparalleled opportunities for attack identification, incident response, and recovery. However, the successful deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas. Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders, regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions. Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical thinking, or contextual understanding is combined with AI's computational power to improve overall cyber defenses.

The advancements in diverse learning tasks have been propelled by the accumulation of more extensive datasets, subsequently facilitating the training of larger models on these datasets. However, these datasets remain relatively under-explored. To this end, we introduce a pioneering approach known as RK-core, to empower gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate hierarchical structure within datasets. Across several benchmark datasets, we find that samples with low coreness values appear less representative of their respective categories, and conversely, those with high coreness values exhibit greater representativeness. Correspondingly, samples with high coreness values make a more substantial contribution to the performance in comparison to those with low coreness values. Building upon this, we further employ RK-core to analyze the hierarchical structure of samples with different coreset selection methods. Remarkably, we find that a high-quality coreset should exhibit hierarchical diversity instead of solely opting for representative samples.

The superior performance of GNNs often correlates with the availability and quality of node-level features in the input networks. However, for many network applications, such node-level information may be missing or unreliable, thereby limiting the applicability and efficacy of GNNs. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach denoted as Ego-centric Spectral subGraph Embedding Augmentation (ESGEA), which aims to enhance and design node features, particularly in scenarios where information is lacking. Our method leverages the topological structure of the local subgraph to create topology-aware node features. The subgraph features are generated using an efficient spectral graph embedding technique, and they serve as node features that capture the local topological organization of the network. The explicit node features, if present, are then enhanced with the subgraph embeddings in order to improve the overall performance. ESGEA is compatible with any GNN-based architecture and is effective even in the absence of node features. We evaluate the proposed method in a social network graph classification task where node attributes are unavailable, as well as in a node classification task where node features are corrupted or even absent. The evaluation results on seven datasets and eight baseline models indicate up to a 10% improvement in AUC and a 7% improvement in accuracy for graph and node classification tasks, respectively. "

Analysing such data-aware systems is a notoriously difficult problem, as they are intrinsically infinite-state. Existing approaches work for specific datatypes, and/or limit themselves to the verification of safety properties. In this paper, we lift both such limitations, studying for the first time linear-time verification for so-called data-aware processes modulo theories (DMTs), from the foundational and practical point of view. The DMT model is very general, as it supports processes operating over variables that can store arbitrary types of data, ranging over infinite domains and equipped with domain-specific predicates. Specifically, we provide four contributions. First, we devise a semi-decision procedure for linear-time verification of DMTs, which works for a very large class of datatypes obeying to mild model-theoretic assumptions. The procedure relies on a unique combination of automata-theoretic and cover computation techniques to respectively deal with linear-time properties and datatypes. Second, we identify an abstract, semantic property that guarantees the existence of a faithful finite-state abstraction of the original system, and show that our method becomes a decision procedure in this case. Third, we identify concrete, checkable classes of systems that satisfy this property, generalising several results in the literature. Finally, we present an implementation and a first experimental evaluation. "

However, the computational accuracy of analog PIM is compromised due to the non-idealities, such as the conductance variation of ReRAM cells. The impact of these non-idealities worsens as the number of concurrently activated wordlines and bitlines increases. To guarantee computational accuracy, only a limited number of wordlines and bitlines of the crossbar array can be turned on concurrently, significantly reducing the achievable parallelism of the architecture. While the constraints on parallelism limit the efficiency of the accelerators, they also provide a new opportunity for fine-grained mixed-precision quantization. To enable efficient DNN inference on practical ReRAM-based accelerators, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design framework called \underline{B}lock-\underline{W}ise mixed-precision \underline{Q}uantization (BWQ). At the algorithm level, BWQ-A introduces a mixed-precision quantization scheme at the block level, which achieves a high weight and activation compression ratio with negligible accuracy degradation. We also present the hardware architecture design BWQ-H, which leverages the low-bit-width models achieved by BWQ-A to perform high-efficiency DNN inference on ReRAM devices. BWQ-H also adopts a novel precision-aware weight mapping method to increase the ReRAM crossbar's throughput. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BWQ, which achieves a 6.08x speedup and a 17.47x energy saving on average compared to existing ReRAM-based architectures. "

In this letter, we classify existing programming abstractions for GNN Aggregation by the dimension of data organization and propagation method. By constructing these abstractions on a state-of-the-art GNN library, we perform a thorough and detailed characterization study to compare their performance and efficiency, and provide several insights on future GNN acceleration based on our analysis.

Here, we hypothesize and study a possible mechanism: new members may be recruited through fringe-interactions: the exchange of comments between members and non-members of fringe communities. We apply text-based causal inference techniques to study the impact of fringe-interactions on the growth of three prominent fringe communities on Reddit: r/Incel, r/GenderCritical, and r/The_Donald. Our results indicate that fringe-interactions attract new members to fringe communities. Users who receive these interactions are up to 4.2 percentage points (pp) more likely to join fringe communities than similar, matched users who do not. This effect is influenced by 1) the characteristics of communities where the interaction happens (e.g., left vs. right-leaning communities) and 2) the language used in the interactions. Interactions using toxic language have a 5pp higher chance of attracting newcomers to fringe communities than non-toxic interactions. We find no effect when repeating this analysis by replacing fringe (r/Incel, r/GenderCritical, and r/The_Donald) with non-fringe communities (r/climatechange, r/NBA, r/leagueoflegends), suggesting this growth mechanism is specific to fringe communities. Overall, our findings suggest that curtailing fringe-interactions may reduce the growth of fringe communities on mainstream platforms. "

Session types are a typing discipline for enforcing safe structured interactions between multiple participants. However, each typed interaction is restricted to having one fixed sender and one fixed receiver. In this paper, we extend session types with existential branching types, to handle a common interaction pattern with multiple senders and a single receiver in a synchronized setting, i.e. a receiver is available to receive messages from multiple senders, and which sender actually participates in the interaction cannot be determined till execution. We build the type system with existential branching types, which retain the important properties induced by standard session types: type safety, progress (i.e. deadlock-freedom), and fidelity. We further provide a novel communication type system to guarantee progress of dynamically interleaved multiparty sessions, by abandoning the strong restrictions of existing type systems. Finally, we encode Rust multi-thread primitives in the extended session types to show the expressivity, which can be considered an attempt to check the deadlock-freedom of Rust multi-thread programs.

However, it is difficult to enhance the robustness since existing datasets are obtained in restricted environments to annotate 3D information. Although neural networks quantitatively achieve a high estimation accuracy, unsatisfied results can be observed in visual quality. This discrepancy between quantitative results and their visual qualities remains an open issue in the hand pose representation. To this end, we propose a mesh represented recycle learning strategy for 3D hand pose and mesh estimation which reinforces synthesized hand mesh representation in a training phase. To be specific, a hand pose and mesh estimation model first predicts parametric 3D hand annotations (i.e., 3D keypoint positions and vertices for hand mesh) with real-world hand images in the training phase. Second, synthetic hand images are generated with self-estimated hand mesh representations. After that, the synthetic hand images are fed into the same model again. Thus, the proposed learning strategy simultaneously improves quantitative results and visual qualities by reinforcing synthetic mesh representation. To encourage consistency between original model output and its recycled one, we propose self-correlation loss which maximizes the accuracy and reliability of our learning strategy. Consequently, the model effectively conducts self-refinement on hand pose estimation by learning mesh representation from its own output. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning strategy, we provide extensive experiments on FreiHAND dataset. Notably, our learning strategy improves the performance on hand pose and mesh estimation without any extra computational burden during the inference. "

Traditional image animation techniques mainly focus on animating natural scenes with random dynamics, such as clouds and fluid, and thus limits their applicability to generic visual contents. To overcome this limitation, we explore the synthesis of dynamic content for open-domain images, converting them into animated videos. The key idea is to utilize the motion prior of text-to-video diffusion models by incorporating the image into the generative process as guidance. Given an image, we first project it into a text-aligned rich image embedding space using a learnable image encoding network, which facilitates the video model to digest the image content compatibly. However, some visual details still struggle to be preserved in the resulting videos. To supplement more precise image information, we further feed the full image to the diffusion model by concatenating it with the initial noises. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method produces visually convincing animated videos, exhibiting both natural motions and high fidelity to the input image. Comparative evaluation demonstrates the notable superiority of our approach over existing competitors. The source code will be released upon publication. "

While differential privacy techniques have been successfully applied to text classification tasks, the resultant semantic bias makes them unsuitable for text generation. Homomorphic encryption inference methods have also been introduced, however, the significant computational and communication costs limit their viability. Furthermore, closed-source, black-box models such as GPT-4 withhold their architecture, thwarting certain privacy-enhancing strategies such as splitting inference into local and remote and then adding noise when communicating. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PrivInfer, the first privacy-preserving inference framework for black-box LLMs in text generation. Inspired by human writing, PrivInfer employs differential privacy methods to generate perturbed prompts for remote LLMs inference and extracts the meaningful response from the remote perturbed results. We also introduce RANTEXT, a differential privacy scheme specifically for LLMs that leverages random adjacency in text perturbations. Experimental results indicate that PrivInfer is comparable to GPT-4 in terms of text generation quality while protecting privacy, and RANTEXT provides enhanced privacy protection against three types of differential privacy attacks, including our newly introduced GPT inference attack, compared to baseline methods.

In recent years, interest in ADTs has increased. For example, popular programming languages, like Python, have added support for ADTs. Automated reasoning about ADTs can be done using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving, an extension of the Boolean satisfiability problem with constraints over first-order structures. Unfortunately, SMT solvers that support ADTs do not scale as state-of-the-art approaches all use variations of the same \emph{lazy} approach. In this paper, we present an SMT solver that takes a fundamentally different approach, an \emph{eager} approach.

In Task-level MoE, different language groups can use different routing strategies to optimize cross-lingual learning and inference speed. In this work, we examine Task-level MoE's applicability in direct NMT and propose a series of high-performing training and evaluation configurations, through which Task-level MoE-based direct NMT systems outperform bilingual and pivot-based models for a large number of low and high-resource direct pairs, and translation directions.

This is challenging because the large variety of objects within a class makes it difficult to infer the task-relevant relationship between the new objects and the objects in the demonstrations. We address this by formulating imitation learning as a conditional alignment problem between graph representations of objects. Consequently, we show that this conditioning allows for in-context learning, where a robot can perform a task on a set of new objects immediately after the demonstrations, without any prior knowledge about the object class or any further training. In our experiments, we explore and validate our design choices, and we show that our method is highly effective for few-shot learning of several real-world, everyday tasks, whilst outperforming baselines.

An $(\alpha,\beta)$-stretch approximate distance oracle (ADO) for $G$ is a data structure that given $u,v\in V$ returns in constant (or near constant) time a value $\hat d (u,v)$ such that $d(u,v) \le \hat d (u,v) \le \alpha\cdot d(u,v) + \beta$, for some reals $\alpha >1, \beta$. If $\beta = 0$, we say that the ADO has stretch $\alpha$. Thorup and Zwick~\cite{thorup2005approximate} showed that one cannot beat stretch 3 with subquadratic space (in terms of $n$) for general graphs. P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu and Roditty~\cite{patrascu2010distance} showed that one can obtain stretch 2 using $O(m^{1/3}n^{4/3})$ space, and so if $m$ is subquadratic in $n$ then the space usage is also subquadratic. Moreover, P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu and Roditty~\cite{patrascu2010distance} showed that one cannot beat stretch 2 with subquadratic space even for graphs where $m=\tilde{O}(n)$, based on the set-intersection hypothesis. In this paper we explore the conditions for which an ADO can be stored using subquadratic space while supporting a sub-2 stretch. In particular, we show that if the maximum degree in $G$ is $\Delta_G \leq O(n^{1/2-\varepsilon})$ for some $0<\varepsilon \leq 1/2$, then there exists an ADO for $G$ that uses $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\frac {2\varepsilon}{3}})$ space and has a sub-2 stretch. Moreover, we prove a conditional lower bound, based on the set intersection hypothesis, which states that for any positive integer $k \leq \log n$, obtaining a sub-$\frac{k+2}{k}$ stretch for graphs with maximum degree $\Theta(n^{1/k})$ requires quadratic space. Thus, for graphs with maximum degree $\Theta(n^{1/2})$, obtaining a sub-2 stretch requires quadratic space. "

In contrast to unconstrained outdoor environments, room structures, floor plans, ventilation systems, and occupant activities all impact the accumulation and spread of pollutants. Yet, comprehensive in-the-wild empirical studies exploring these unique indoor air pollution patterns and scope are lacking. To address this, we conducted a three-month-long field study involving over 28 indoor spaces to delve into the complexities of indoor air pollution. Our study was conducted using our custom-built DALTON air quality sensor and monitoring system, an innovative IoT air quality monitoring solution that considers cost, sensor type, accuracy, network connectivity, power, and usability. Our study also revealed that conventional measures, such as the Indoor Air Quality Index (IAQI), don't fully capture complex indoor air quality dynamics. Hence, we proposed the Healthy Home Index (HHI), a new metric considering the context and household activities, offering a more comprehensive understanding of indoor air quality. Our findings suggest that HHI provides a more accurate air quality assessment, underscoring the potential for wide-scale deployment of our indoor air quality monitoring platform. "

In response to these limitations, we introduce REVAMP, an easy-to-use Python library that is the first-of-its-kind tool for creating attack scenarios with arbitrary objects and simulating realistic environmental factors, lighting, reflection, and refraction. REVAMP enables researchers and practitioners to swiftly explore various scenarios within the digital realm by offering a wide range of configurable options for designing experiments and using differentiable rendering to reproduce physically plausible adversarial objects. We will demonstrate and invite the audience to try REVAMP to produce an adversarial texture on a chosen object while having control over various scene parameters.

Then, in real time, we show how this altered texture causes the chosen object to be mis-classified, showcasing the potential of REVAMP in real-world scenarios.

Various methods have been proposed for this problem, but it is still unclear how they are related and when practitioners should choose one method over another. In response, we propose a unified framework, dubbed Unified Domain Incremental Learning (UDIL), for domain incremental learning with memory. Our UDIL **unifies** various existing methods, and our theoretical analysis shows that UDIL always achieves a tighter generalization error bound compared to these methods. The key insight is that different existing methods correspond to our bound with different **fixed** coefficients; based on insights from this unification, our UDIL allows **adaptive** coefficients during training, thereby always achieving the tightest bound. Empirical results show that our UDIL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain incremental learning methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Travis Waller, Yu Mei, Yunpeng Wang, Meng Wang",New submissions,Systems and Control (eess.SY),"The link transmission model (LTM) is an efficient and widely used macro-level approach for simulating traffic flow. However, the state-of-the-art LTMs usually focused on segment-level modelling, in which the traffic operation differences among multiple turning directions are neglected. Such models are incapable of differentiating the turn-level queue transmission, resulting in underrepresented queue spillbacks and misidentification of bottlenecks. Moreover, a constant free-flow speed is usually assumed to formulate LTMs, restricting their applications to model dynamic traffic management strategies involving variable speed limits (VSL) and connected and automated vehicles. This study proposed an extended LTM with VSL and turn-level queue transmission to capture the traffic flow propagation at signalized intersections. First, each road segment (RS) with multiple turning directions is divided into many free-flow and queueing parts characterized by the triangular fundamental diagrams. Then, the vehicle propagation within the link is described by the turn-level link inflow, queue inflow, and outflow, which depends on the free-flow speed changes. A node model involving an iterative procedure is further defined to capture the potential queue spillback, which estimates the actual flow propagation between the adjacent RSs. Simulated and field data were used to verify the proposed model performance. Results reveal that the proposed LTM predict traffic operations of complex intersections with multiple turning movements, VSL and signal control schemes, and enables an accurate yet computationally tractable representation of flow propagation.

Vincent Poor",New submissions,Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Systems and Control (eess.SY),"The widespread deployment of ""smart"" electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) will be a key step toward achieving green transportation. The connectivity features of smart EVCSs can be utilized to schedule EV charging operations while respecting user preferences, thus avoiding synchronous charging from a large number of customers and relieving grid congestion. However, the communication and connectivity requirements involved in smart charging raise cybersecurity concerns. In this work, we investigate charge manipulation attacks (CMAs) against EV charging, in which an attacker manipulates the information exchanged during smart charging operations. The objective of CMAs is to shift the EV aggregator's demand across different times of the day. The proposed CMAs can bypass existing protection mechanisms in EV communication protocols. We quantify the impact of CMAs on the EV aggregator's economic profit by modeling their participation in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets. Finally, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based mechanism to detect CMAs by monitoring the parameters involved in EV charging. We extensively analyze the attack impact and the efficiency of the proposed detection on real-world EV charging datasets. The results highlight the vulnerabilities of smart charging operations and the need for a monitoring mechanism to detect malicious CMAs. "

Similarity constraint works as a tutor to instruct the generator network to comprehend the difference of representations based on conditions. We understand how SCGAN works on a deeper level. This understanding makes us realize that the similarity constraint functions like the contrastive loss function. We believe that a model with high understanding and intelligence measures the similarity between images based on their structure and high level features, just like humans do. Two major changes we applied to SCGAN in order to make a modified model are using SSIM to measure similarity between images and applying contrastive loss principles to the similarity constraint. The modified model performs better using FID and FactorVAE metrics. The modified model also has better generalisability compared to other models.

While model-based methods have shown promising results in solving long-horizon manipulation tasks, they often work under strict assumptions, such as known model parameters, oracular observation of the environment state, and simplified dynamics, resulting in plans that cannot easily transfer to hardware. Learning-based approaches, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), have been shown to be robust when operating over in-distribution states; however, they need heavy human supervision. Specifically, model-free RL requires a tedious reward-shaping process. IL methods, on the other hand, rely on human demonstrations that involve advanced teleoperation methods. In this work, we propose a plan-guided reinforcement learning (PGRL) framework to combine the advantages of model-based planning and reinforcement learning. Our method requires minimal human supervision because it relies on plans generated by model-based planners to guide the exploration in RL. In exchange, RL derives a more robust policy thanks to domain randomization. We test this approach on a whole-body manipulation task on Punyo, an upper-body humanoid robot with compliant, air-filled arm coverings, to pivot and lift a large box. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed methodology is promising to address challenges that remain difficult for either model- or learning-based strategies alone. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 27,Weakly-Popular and Super-Popular Matchings with Ties and Their  Connection to Stable Matchings,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12269,Gergely Csáji,New submissions,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"In this paper, we study a slightly different definition of popularity in bipartite graphs $G=(U,W,E)$ with two-sided preferences, when ties are present in the preference lists. This is motivated by the observation that if an agent $u$ is indifferent between his original partner $w$ in matching $M$ and his new partner $w'\ne w$ in matching $N$, then he may probably still prefer to stay with his original partner, as change requires effort, so he votes for $M$ in this case, instead of being indifferent. We show that this alternative definition of popularity, which we call weak-popularity allows us to guarantee the existence of such a matching and also to find a weakly-popular matching in polynomial-time that has size at least $\frac{3}{4}$ the size of the maximum weakly popular matching. We also show that this matching is at least $\frac{4}{5}$ times the size of the maximum (weakly) stable matching, so may provide a more desirable solution than the current best (and tight under certain assumptions) $\frac{2}{3}$-approximation for such a stable matching. We also show that unfortunately, finding a maximum size weakly popular matching is NP-hard, even with one-sided ties and that assuming some complexity theoretic assumptions, the $\frac{3}{4}$-approximation bound is tight. Then, we study a more general model than weak-popularity, where for each edge, we can specify independently for both endpoints the size of improvement the endpoint needs to vote in favor of a new matching $N$. We show that even in this more general model, a so-called $\gamma$-popular matching always exists and that the same positive results still hold. Finally, we define an other, stronger variant of popularity, called super-popularity, where even a weak improvement is enough to vote in favor of a new matching. We show that for this case, even the existence problem is NP-hard. "

We consider both the classical setting with elementary operations of arity $2$ and the generalized setting with operations of arity $k$, where $k$ is a parameter. For both problems and both settings, there are various constructions known, the minimal known depth being logarithmic. However, there is currently no known construction that simultaneously achieves sub-log-squared depth, effective constructability, simplicity, and has a potential to be used in practice. In this paper we make progress towards resolution of this problem. For computing majority by standard monotone circuits (gates of arity 2) we provide an explicit monotone circuit of depth $O(\log_2^{5/3} n)$. The construction is a combination of several known and not too complicated ideas. For arbitrary arity of gates $k$ we provide a new sorting network architecture inspired by representation of inputs as a high-dimensional cube. As a result we provide a simple construction that improves previous upper bound of $4 \log_k^2 n$ to $2 \log_k^2 n$. We prove the similar bound for the depth of the circuit computing majority of $n$ bits consisting of gates computing majority of $k$ bits. Note, that for both problems there is an explicit construction of depth $O(\log_k n)$ known, but the construction is complicated and the constant hidden in $O$-notation is huge. "

However, identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts within one scene poses significant challenges even when embeddings for individual concepts are attainable. This is further confirmed by our empirical tests. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL), where multiple new ""words"" are simultaneously learned from a single sentence-image pair. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept correlation, we propose three regularisation techniques: Attention Masking (AttnMask) to concentrate learning on relevant areas; Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL) to separate the embeddings of different concepts; and Bind adjective (Bind adj.) to associate new ""words"" with known words. We evaluate via image generation, editing, and attention visualisation with diverse images. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method can learn more semantically disentangled concepts with enhanced word-concept correlation. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset and evaluation protocol tailored for this new task of learning object-level concepts. "

Dunham",New submissions,Numerical Analysis (math.NA),"We present an adjoint-based optimization method to invert for frictional parameters used in earthquake modeling. The forward problem is linear elasticity with nonlinear rate-and-state frictional faults. The misfit functional quantifies the difference between simulated and measured particle displacements or velocities at receiver locations. The misfit may include windowing or filtering operators. We derive the corresponding adjoint problem, which is linear elasticity with linear rate-and-state friction. The gradient of the misfit is efficiently computed by convolving forward and adjoint variables on the fault. The method thus extends the framework of full-waveform inversion to include frictional faults with rate-and-state friction. In addition, we present a space-time dual-consistent discretization of a dynamic rupture problem with a rough fault in antiplane shear, using high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite differences in combination with explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The dual consistency of the discretization ensures that the discrete adjoint-based gradient is the exact gradient of the discrete cost functional as well as a consistent approximation of the continuous gradient. Our theoretical results are corroborated by inversions with synthetic data. "

Unlike traditional classrooms, MOOCs offer a unique opportunity to cater to a diverse audience from different backgrounds and geographical locations. Renowned universities and MOOC-specific providers, such as Coursera, offer MOOC courses on various subjects. Automated assessment tasks like grade and early dropout predictions are necessary due to the high enrollment and limited direct interaction between teachers and learners. However, current automated assessment approaches overlook the structural links between different entities involved in the downstream tasks, such as the students and courses. Our hypothesis suggests that these structural relationships, manifested through an interaction graph, contain valuable information that can enhance the performance of the task at hand. To validate this, we construct a unique knowledge graph for a large MOOC dataset, which will be publicly available to the research community. Furthermore, we utilize graph embedding techniques to extract latent structural information encoded in the interactions between entities in the dataset. These techniques do not require ground truth labels and can be utilized for various tasks. Finally, by combining entity-specific features, behavioral features, and extracted structural features, we enhance the performance of predictive machine learning models in student assignment grade prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that structural features can significantly improve the predictive performance of downstream assessment tasks.

Each team consists of a homogeneous population of agents. Agents within a team are cooperative while the teams compete with other teams. The dynamics and the costs are coupled through the empirical distribution (or the mean field) of the state of agents in each team. This mean-field is assumed to be observed by all agents. Agents have asymmetric information (also called a non-classical information structure). We propose a mean-field based refinement of the Team-Nash equilibrium of the game, which we call mean-field Markov perfect equilibrium (MF-MPE). We identify a dynamic programming decomposition to characterize MF-MPE. We then consider the case where each team has a large number of players and present a mean-field approximation which approximates the game among large-population teams as a game among infinite-population teams. We show that MF-MPE of the game among teams of infinite population is easier to compute and is an $\varepsilon$-approximate MF-MPE of the game among teams of finite population. "

Gary Wang",New submissions,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Image and Video Processing (eess.IV),"Hot-wire directed energy deposition using a laser beam (DED-LB/w) is a method of metal additive manufacturing (AM) that has benefits of high material utilization and deposition rate, but parts manufactured by DED-LB/w suffer from a substantial heat input and undesired surface finish. Hence, monitoring and controlling the process parameters and signatures during the deposition is crucial to ensure the quality of final part properties and geometries. This paper explores the dynamic modeling of the DED-LB/w process and introduces a parameter-signature-property modeling and control approach to enhance the quality of modeling and control of part properties that cannot be measured in situ. The study investigates different process parameters that influence the melt pool width (signature) and bead width (property) in single and multi-layer beads. The proposed modeling approach utilizes a parameter-signature model as F_1 and a signature-property model as F_2. Linear and nonlinear modeling approaches are compared to describe a dynamic relationship between process parameters and a process signature, the melt pool width (F_1). A fully connected artificial neural network is employed to model and predict the final part property, i.e., bead width, based on melt pool signatures (F_2). Finally, the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed parameter-signature-property modeling is tested and verified by integrating the parameter-signature (F_1) and signature-property (F_2) models in the closed-loop control of the width of the part. Compared with the control loop with only F_1, the proposed method shows clear advantages and bears potential to be applied to control other part properties that cannot be directly measured or monitored in situ.

We conducted a field study in two cafes with a teleoperated robot Nao, which sat next to the counter serving as an assistant to a human barista. We observed customer behavior, conducted semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with the customers. The results show that Polish customers are neutral and insecure about robots. However, they do not exhibit a total dislike of these technologies. We considered three stages of the interaction and identified features of each stage that need to be designed carefully to yield user satisfaction. "

First, prior studies treat the JIT-SDP problem solely as a classification problem. Second, prior JIT-SDP studies do not consider that class balancing processing may change the underlying characteristics of software changeset data. Third, only a single source of concept drift, the class imbalance evolution is addressed in prior JIT-SDP incremental learning models. We propose an incremental learning framework called CPI-JIT for JIT-SDP. First, in addition to a classification modeling component, the framework includes a time-series forecast modeling component in order to learn temporal interdependent relationship in the changesets. Second, the framework features a purposefully designed over-sampling balancing technique based on SMOTE and Principal Curves called SMOTE-PC. SMOTE-PC preserves the underlying distribution of software changeset data. In this framework, we propose an incremental deep neural network model called DeepICP. Via an evaluation using \numprojs software projects, we show that: 1) SMOTE-PC improves the model's predictive performance; 2) to some software projects it can be beneficial for defect prediction to harness temporal interdependent relationship of software changesets; and 3) principal curves summarize the underlying distribution of changeset data and reveals a new source of concept drift that the DeepICP model is proposed to adapt to.

Agent modeling is crucial to facilitate agent interactions and make adaptive cooperation strategies. However, it is challenging for agents to model the beliefs, behaviors, and intentions of other agents in non-stationary environment where all agent policies are learned simultaneously. In addition, the existing methods realize agent modeling through behavior cloning which assume that the local information of other agents can be accessed during execution or training. However, this assumption is infeasible in unknown scenarios characterized by unknown agents, such as competition teams, unreliable communication and federated learning due to privacy concerns. To eliminate this assumption and achieve agent modeling in unknown scenarios, Fact-based Agent modeling (FAM) method is proposed in which fact-based belief inference (FBI) network models other agents in partially observable environment only based on its local information. The reward and observation obtained by agents after taking actions are called facts, and FAM uses facts as reconstruction target to learn the policy representation of other agents through a variational autoencoder. We evaluate FAM on various Multiagent Particle Environment (MPE) and compare the results with several state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. Experimental results show that compared with baseline methods, FAM can effectively improve the efficiency of agent policy learning by making adaptive cooperation strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks, while achieving higher returns in complex competitive-cooperative mixed scenarios.

Most existing methods are unsupervised and assume the availability of normal training samples only, while few supervised methods have shown superior performance by incorporating labeled anomalous samples in the training phase. However, certain anomaly types are inherently challenging for unsupervised methods to differentiate from normal data, while supervised methods are constrained to detecting anomalies resembling those present during training, failing to generalize to unseen anomaly classes. This paper is the first attempt in providing a novel approach for the open-set TSAD problem, in which a small number of labeled anomalies from a limited class of anomalies are visible in the training phase, with the objective of detecting both seen and unseen anomaly classes in the test phase. The proposed method, called Multivariate Open-Set timeseries Anomaly Detection (MOSAD) consists of three primary modules: a Feature Extractor to extract meaningful time-series features; a Multi-head Network consisting of Generative-, Deviation-, and Contrastive heads for capturing both seen and unseen anomaly classes; and an Anomaly Scoring module leveraging the insights of the three heads to detect anomalies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently show that our approach surpasses existing methods under various experimental settings, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the TSAD field.

Recently, approaches in this research area shifted from concentrating on ConvNet-based to transformer-based models. In addition, various interpretability approaches have appeared for transformer models and video temporal dynamics, motivated by the growing interest in basic scientific understanding, model diagnostics and societal implications of real-world deployment. Previous surveys mainly focused on ConvNet models on a subset of video segmentation tasks or transformers for classification tasks. Moreover, component-wise discussion of transformer-based video segmentation models has not yet received due focus. In addition, previous reviews of interpretability methods focused on transformers for classification, while analysis of video temporal dynamics modelling capabilities of video models received less attention. In this survey, we address the above with a thorough discussion of various categories of video segmentation, a component-wise discussion of the state-of-the-art transformer-based models, and a review of related interpretability methods. We first present an introduction to the different video segmentation task categories, their objectives, specific challenges and benchmark datasets. Next, we provide a component-wise review of recent transformer-based models and document the state of the art on different video segmentation tasks.

We address the primary computational bottleneck of computing matrix inverses by completely eliminating them using an approximation of the preconditioner computation. This makes Jorge extremely efficient on GPUs in terms of wall-clock time. Further, we describe an approach to determine Jorge's hyperparameters directly from a well-tuned SGD baseline, thereby significantly minimizing tuning efforts. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the distinct advantages of using Jorge, outperforming state-of-the-art optimizers such as SGD, AdamW, and Shampoo across multiple deep learning models, both in terms of sample efficiency and wall-clock time.

In this work, we adapt a recently proposed hardness metric, pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-usable information (PVI), to an in-context version (in-context PVI). Compared to the original PVI, in-context PVI is more efficient in that it requires only a few exemplars and does not require fine-tuning. We conducted a comprehensive empirical analysis to evaluate the reliability of in-context PVI. Our findings indicate that in-context PVI estimates exhibit similar characteristics to the original PVI. Specific to the in-context setting, we show that in-context PVI estimates remain consistent across different exemplar selections and numbers of shots. The variance of in-context PVI estimates across different exemplar selections is insignificant, which suggests that in-context PVI are stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how in-context PVI can be employed to identify challenging instances. Our work highlights the potential of in-context PVI and provides new insights into the capabilities of ICL. "

This can be achieved by combining any existing sentence-level translation model with a document-level language model. We improve existing approaches by leveraging recent advancements in model combination.

This unlocks the potential for extensive decentralized gaming applications. This paper aims to provide insights into designing a fair, verifiable, and efficient smart contract game on blockchain by the example of building raffles on the Sui Network. We explore efficient methods for implementing randomness on smart contracts, including DRAND committee-based decentralized random beacons and single private-key-based verifiable random functions (VRF). Then, progress from basic to comprehensive smart contract design. We addressed limitations in developing blockchain games in general, such as data input and storage space constraints. We propose corresponding solutions, encompassing the utilization of Object Tables, Delegate Object Creation, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to optimize storage and input efficiency. After testing our designs, we found that the transaction fees for DRAND beacons and private-key-based VRFs are similar. Moreover, Object Tables incur higher overall transaction fees, while the ZKP setup fee is cheap but becomes very expensive during the verification process.

Our findings provide valuable guidance for future researchers and developers in building random, fair, and verifiable games with smart contracts. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 43,Towards Understanding and Characterizing the Arbitrage Bot Scam In the  Wild,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12306,"Kai Li, Shixuan Guan, Darren Lee",New submissions,Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of an emerging cryptocurrency scam named ""arbitrage bot"" disseminated on online social networks. The scam revolves around Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) arbitrage and aims to lure victims into executing a so-called ""bot contract"" to steal funds from them. To collect the scam at a large scale, we developed a fully automated scam detection system named CryptoScamHunter, which continuously collects YouTube videos and automatically detects scams. Meanwhile, CryptoScamHunter can download the source code of the bot contract from the provided links and extract the associated scam cryptocurrency address. Through deploying CryptoScamHunter from Jun. 2022 to Jun. 2023, we have detected 10,442 arbitrage bot scam videos published from thousands of YouTube accounts. Our analysis reveals that different strategies have been utilized in spreading the scam, including crafting popular accounts, registering spam accounts, and using obfuscation tricks to hide the real scam address in the bot contracts. Moreover, from the scam videos we have collected over 800 malicious bot contracts with source code and extracted 354 scam addresses. By further expanding the scam addresses with a similar contract matching technique, we have obtained a total of 1,697 scam addresses. Through tracing the transactions of all scam addresses on the Ethereum mainnet and Binance Smart Chain, we reveal that over 25,000 victims have fallen prey to this scam, resulting in a financial loss of up to 15 million USD. Overall, our work sheds light on the dissemination tactics and censorship evasion strategies adopted in the arbitrage bot scam, as well as on the scale and impact of such a scam on online social networks and blockchain platforms, emphasizing the urgent need for effective detection and prevention mechanisms against such fraudulent activity.

Acceptability semantics of formal argumentation systems define the criteria for the acceptance or rejection of arguments. Several software systems, known as argumentation solvers, have been developed to compute the accepted/rejected arguments using such criteria. These include systems that learn to identify the accepted arguments using non-interpretable methods. In this paper we present a novel framework, which uses an Inductive Logic Programming approach to learn the acceptability semantics for several abstract and structured argumentation frameworks in an interpretable way. Through an empirical evaluation we show that our framework outperforms existing argumentation solvers, thus opening up new future research directions in the area of formal argumentation and human-machine dialogues.

Our investigation stems from the recognition that SA has become an integral component of diverse sociotechnical systems, exerting influence on both social and technical users. By delving into sociological and technological literature on sentiment, we unveil distinct conceptualizations of this term in domains such as finance, government, and medicine. Our study exposes a lack of explicit definitions and frameworks for characterizing sentiment, resulting in potential challenges and biases. To tackle this issue, we propose an ethics sheet encompassing critical inquiries to guide practitioners in ensuring equitable utilization of SA. Our findings underscore the significance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to defining sentiment in SA and offer a pragmatic solution for its implementation. "

LLMs, because of their large size and pretraining on large volumes of text data, exhibit special abilities which allow them to achieve remarkable performances without any task-specific training in many of the natural language processing tasks. The era of LLMs started with OpenAI GPT-3 model, and the popularity of LLMs is increasing exponentially after the introduction of models like ChatGPT and GPT4. We refer to GPT-3 and its successor OpenAI models, including ChatGPT and GPT4, as GPT-3 family large language models (GLLMs). With the ever-rising popularity of GLLMs, especially in the research community, there is a strong need for a comprehensive survey which summarizes the recent research progress in multiple dimensions and can guide the research community with insightful future research directions. We start the survey paper with foundation concepts like transformers, transfer learning, self-supervised learning, pretrained language models and large language models. We then present a brief overview of GLLMs and discuss the performances of GLLMs in various downstream tasks, specific domains and multiple languages. We also discuss the data labelling and data augmentation abilities of GLLMs, the robustness of GLLMs, the effectiveness of GLLMs as evaluators, and finally, conclude with multiple insightful future research directions. To summarize, this comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good resource for both academic and industry people to stay updated with the latest research related to GPT-3 family large language models.

However, traditional experiments do not have a clear and simple pathway to using data rapidly to try to increase the chances that students in an experiment get the best conditions. Drawing inspiration from the use of machine learning and experimentation in product development at leading technology companies, we explore how adaptive experimentation might help in continuous course improvement. In adaptive experiments, as different arms/conditions are deployed to students, data is analyzed and used to change the experience for future students. This can be done using machine learning algorithms to identify which actions are more promising for improving student experience or outcomes. This algorithm can then dynamically deploy the most effective conditions to future students, resulting in better support for students' needs. We illustrate the approach with a case study providing a side-by-side comparison of traditional and adaptive experimentation of self-explanation prompts in online homework problems in a CS1 course. This provides a first step in exploring the future of how this methodology can be useful in bridging research and practice in doing continuous improvement. "

This is also the case for professional sports, where leagues, clubs and players are using social media to reach out to their fans. In this respect, a huge amount of time is spent curating multimedia content for various social media platforms and their target users. With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), AI-based tools for automating content generation and enhancing user experiences on social media have become widely popular. However, to effectively utilize such tools, it is imperative to comprehend the demographics and preferences of users on different platforms, understand how content providers post information in these channels, and how different types of multimedia are consumed by audiences. This report presents an analysis of social media platforms, in terms of demographics, supported multimedia modalities, and distinct features and specifications for different modalities, followed by a comparative case study of select European soccer leagues and teams, in terms of their social media practices. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that social media, while being very important for and widely used by supporters from all ages, also requires a fine-tuned effort on the part of soccer professionals, in order to elevate fan experiences and foster engagement.

While these strides are promising, current supervised learning approaches for WSI analysis come with the challenge of exhaustively labeling high-resolution slides - a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, self-supervised learning (SSL) pretraining strategies are emerging as a viable alternative, given that they don't rely on explicit data annotations. These SSL strategies are quickly bridging the performance disparity with their supervised counterparts. In this context, we introduce an SSL framework. This framework aims for transferable representation learning and semantically meaningful clustering by synergizing invariance loss and clustering loss in WSI analysis. Notably, our approach outperforms common SSL methods in downstream classification and clustering tasks, as evidenced by tests on the Camelyon16 and a pancreatic cancer dataset.

Finding bugs is one aspect of testing the correctness of compilers in wide use today. A compiler is correct if every compiled program behaves as allowed by the semantics of its source code - else there is a bug. Memory consistency models define the semantics of concurrent programs. We focus on how to detect concurrency bugs introduced by compilers, as identified using memory models. We seek a testing technique that automatically covers concurrency bugs up to fixed bounds on program sizes and that scales to find bugs in compiled programs with many lines of code. Otherwise, a testing technique can miss bugs. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art techniques are yet to satisfy all of these properties. We present the T\'el\'echat compiler testing tool for concurrent programs. T\'el\'echat finds a concurrency bug when the behaviour of a compiled program, as allowed by its architecture memory model, is not a behaviour of the source program under its source model. We make three claims: T\'el\'echat improves the state-of-the-art at finding bugs in code generation for multi-threaded execution, it is the first public description of a compiler testing tool for concurrency that is deployed in industry, and it is the first tool that takes a significant step towards the desired properties. We provide experimental evidence suggesting T\'el\'echat finds bugs missed by other state-of-the-art techniques, case studies indicating that T\'el\'echat satisfies the properties, and reports of our experience deploying T\'el\'echat in industry.

However, the human mind is complicated and mixed with both linear and nonlinear thinking. In this work, we propose \textbf{I}nferential \textbf{E}xclusion \textbf{P}rompting (IEP), a novel prompting that combines the principles of elimination and inference in order to guide LLMs to think non-linearly. IEP guides LLMs to plan and then utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) to deduce each possible solution's entailment relation with context, commonsense, or facts, therefore yielding a broader perspective by thinking back for inferring. This forward planning and backward eliminating process allows IEP to better simulate the complex human thinking processes compared to other CoT-based methods, which only reflect linear cognitive processes. We conducted a series of empirical studies and have corroborated that IEP consistently outperforms CoT across various tasks. Additionally, we observe that integrating IEP and CoT further improves the LLMs' performance on certain tasks, highlighting the necessity of equipping LLMs with mixed logic processes. Moreover, to better evaluate comprehensive features inherent in human logic, we introduce \textbf{M}ental-\textbf{A}bility \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{B}enchmark (MARB). The benchmark comprises six novel subtasks with a total of 9,115 questions, among which 1,685 are developed with hand-crafted rationale references.

In this paper, we develop two FSL frameworks that fit in wireless transceiver design. Both frameworks are base on optimization programs that can be solved by well-known algorithms like the inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (iADMM) and the inexact alternating direction method (iADM). As examples, we demonstrate how the proposed two FSL frameworks are used for the OFDM receiver and beamforming (BF) for the millimeter wave (mmWave) system.

However, they tend to struggle when deployed in an unseen environment. This lack of generalizability is due to the agent's insensitivity to subtle changes in natural language instructions. To mitigate this issue, we propose explicitly aligning the agent's hidden states with the instructions via contrastive learning. Nevertheless, the semantic gap between high-level language instructions and the agent's low-level action space remains an obstacle. Therefore, we further introduce a novel concept of meta-actions to bridge the gap. Meta-actions are ubiquitous action patterns that can be parsed from the original action sequence. These patterns represent higher-level semantics that are intuitively aligned closer to the instructions. When meta-actions are applied as additional training signals, the agent generalizes better to unseen environments. Compared to a strong multi-modal Transformer baseline, we achieve a significant 4.5% absolute gain in success rate in unseen environments of ALFRED Embodied Instruction Following. Additional analysis shows that the contrastive objective and meta-actions are complementary in achieving the best results, and the resulting agent better aligns its states with corresponding instructions, making it more suitable for real-world embodied agents.

The societal integration of UAS is a pivotal challenge, as these systems must operate harmoniously within the constraints imposed by regulations and societal concerns. In complex urban environments, UAS safety has been a perennial obstacle to their large-scale deployment. To mitigate UAS safety risk and facilitate risk-aware UAS operations planning, we propose a novel concept called \textit{3D virtual risk terrain}. This concept converts public risk constraints in an urban environment into 3D exclusion zones that UAS operations should avoid to adequately reduce risk to Entities of Value (EoV). To implement the 3D virtual risk terrain, we develop a conditional probability framework that comprehensively integrates most existing basic models for UAS ground risk. To demonstrate the concept, we build risk terrains on a Chicago downtown model and observe their characteristics under different conditions. We believe that the 3D virtual risk terrain has the potential to become a new routine tool for risk-aware UAS operations planning, urban airspace management, and policy development. The same idea can also be extended to other forms of societal impacts, such as noise, privacy, and perceived risk. "

Training GNNs over centralized graph data can be infeasible due to privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. Thus, federated learning (FL) becomes a trending solution to address this challenge in a distributed learning paradigm. However, as GNNs may inherit historical bias from training data and lead to discriminatory predictions, the bias of local models can be easily propagated to the global model in distributed settings. This poses a new challenge in mitigating bias in federated GNNs. To address this challenge, we propose $\text{F}^2$GNN, a Fair Federated Graph Neural Network, that enhances group fairness of federated GNNs. As bias can be sourced from both data and learning algorithms, $\text{F}^2$GNN aims to mitigate both types of bias under federated settings. First, we provide theoretical insights on the connection between data bias in a training graph and statistical fairness metrics of the trained GNN models. Based on the theoretical analysis, we design $\text{F}^2$GNN which contains two key components: a fairness-aware local model update scheme that enhances group fairness of the local models on the client side, and a fairness-weighted global model update scheme that takes both data bias and fairness metrics of local models into consideration in the aggregation process. We evaluate $\text{F}^2$GNN empirically versus a number of baseline methods, and demonstrate that $\text{F}^2$GNN outperforms these baselines in terms of both fairness and model accuracy. "

While traffic forecasting has been approached with a variety of techniques over the last couple of decades, most approaches simply rely on endogenous traffic variables for state prediction, despite the evidence that exogenous factors can significantly impact traffic conditions. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional spatio-temporal graph attention-based traffic prediction approach (M-STGAT), which predicts traffic based on past observations of speed, along with lane closure events, temperature, and visibility across the transportation network. The approach is based on a graph attention network architecture, which also learns based on the structure of the transportation network on which these variables are observed. Numerical experiments are performed using traffic speed and lane closure data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The corresponding weather data were downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS). For comparison, the numerical experiments implement three alternative models which do not allow for the multi-dimensional input. The M-STGAT is shown to outperform the three alternative models, when performing tests using our primary data set for prediction with a 30-, 45-, and 60-minute prediction horizon, in terms of three error measures: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). However, the model's transferability can vary for different transfer data sets and this aspect may require further investigation. "

The agents learn through a reward structure that incorporates adaptability to traffic conditions, safety, and mobility; enabling coordination among the agents. The proposed framework scales to cover corridors with many gantries thanks to a parameter sharing among all VSL agents. The agents are trained in a microsimulation environment based on a short freeway stretch with 8 gantries spanning 7 miles and tested with 34 gantries spanning 17 miles of I-24 near Nashville, TN. MARVEL improves traffic safety by 63.4% compared to the no control scenario and enhances traffic mobility by 14.6% compared to a state-of-the-practice algorithm that has been deployed on I-24. An explainability analysis is undertaken to explore the learned policy under different traffic conditions and the results provide insights into the decision-making process of agents. Finally, we test the policy learned from the simulation-based experiments on real input data from I-24 to illustrate the potential deployment capability of the learned policy. "

To address this, we propose GRI that combines the distributional training objectives with attentive graph convolutions to unanimously consider the impact of semantically similar words required to define/compute the relative isomorphism of multiple spaces. Experimental evaluation shows that GRI outperforms the existing research by improving the average P@1 by a relative score of up to 63.6%.

To address the challenges, REMARK-LLM proposes three new components: (i) a learning-based message encoding module to infuse binary signatures into LLM-generated texts; (ii) a reparameterization module to transform the dense distributions from the message encoding to the sparse distribution of the watermarked textual tokens; (iii) a decoding module dedicated for signature extraction; Furthermore, we introduce an optimized beam search algorithm to guarantee the coherence and consistency of the generated content. REMARK-LLM is rigorously trained to encourage the preservation of semantic integrity in watermarked content, while ensuring effective watermark retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple unseen datasets highlight REMARK-LLM proficiency and transferability in inserting 2 times more signature bits into the same texts when compared to prior art, all while maintaining semantic integrity. Furthermore, REMARK-LLM exhibits better resilience against a spectrum of watermark detection and removal attacks. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 68,On Identifying Points of Semantic Shift Across Domains,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12369,"Hyung Wook Choi, Mat Kelly",New submissions,Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"The semantics used for particular terms in an academic field organically evolve over time. Tracking this evolution through inspection of published literature has either been from the perspective of Linguistic scholars or has concentrated the focus of term evolution within a single domain of study. In this paper, we performed a case study to identify semantic evolution across different domains and identify examples of inter-domain semantic shifts. We initially used keywords as the basis of our search and executed an iterative process of following citations to find the initial mention of the concepts in the field. We found that a select set of keywords like ``semaphore'', ``polymorphism'', and ``ontology'' were mentioned within Computer Science literature and tracked the seminal study that borrowed those terms from original fields by citations. We marked these events as semantic evolution points. Through this manual investigation method, we can identify term evolution across different academic fields. This study reports our initial findings that will seed future automated and computational methods of incorporating concepts from additional academic fields. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 69,No-Regret Learning in Bilateral Trade via Global Budget Balance,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12370,"Martino Bernasconi, Matteo Castiglioni, Andrea Celli, Federico Fusco",New submissions,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Bilateral trade revolves around the challenge of facilitating transactions between two strategic agents -- a seller and a buyer -- both of whom have a private valuations for the item. We study the online version of the problem, in which at each time step a new seller and buyer arrive. The learner's task is to set a price for each agent, without any knowledge about their valuations. The sequence of sellers and buyers is chosen by an oblivious adversary. In this setting, known negative results rule out the possibility of designing algorithms with sublinear regret when the learner has to guarantee budget balance for each iteration. In this paper, we introduce the notion of global budget balance, which requires the agent to be budget balance only over the entire time horizon. By requiring global budget balance, we provide the first no-regret algorithms for bilateral trade with adversarial inputs under various feedback models. First, we show that in the full-feedback model the learner can guarantee $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret against the best fixed prices in hindsight, which is order-wise optimal. Then, in the case of partial feedback models, we provide an algorithm guaranteeing a $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret upper bound with one-bit feedback, which we complement with a nearly-matching lower bound. Finally, we investigate how these results vary when measuring regret using an alternative benchmark. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 70,Nearly Optimal Bounds for Sample-Based Testing and Learning of  $k$-Monotone Functions,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12375,Hadley Black,New submissions,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"We study monotonicity testing of functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}$ using sample-based algorithms, which are only allowed to observe the value of $f$ on points drawn independently from the uniform distribution. A classic result by Bshouty-Tamon (J. ACM 1996) proved that monotone functions can be learned with $\exp(O(\min\{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{d},d\}))$ samples and it is not hard to show that this bound extends to testing. Prior to our work the only lower bound for this problem was $\Omega(\sqrt{\exp(d)/\varepsilon})$ in the small $\varepsilon$ parameter regime, when $\varepsilon = O(d^{-3/2})$, due to Goldreich-Goldwasser-Lehman-Ron-Samorodnitsky (Combinatorica 2000). Thus, the sample complexity of monotonicity testing was wide open for $\varepsilon \gg d^{-3/2}$. We resolve this question, obtaining a tight lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(\min\{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{d},d\}))$ for all $\varepsilon$ at most a sufficiently small constant. In fact, we prove a much more general result, showing that the sample complexity of $k$-monotonicity testing and learning for functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to [r]$ is $\exp(\Theta(\min\{\frac{rk}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{d},d\}))$. For testing with one-sided error we show that the sample complexity is $\exp(\Theta(d))$. Beyond the hypercube, we prove nearly tight bounds (up to polylog factors of $d,k,r,1/\varepsilon$ in the exponent) of $\exp(\widetilde{\Theta}(\min\{\frac{rk}{\varepsilon}\sqrt{d},d\}))$ on the sample complexity of testing and learning measurable $k$-monotone functions $f \colon \mathbb{R}^d \to [r]$ under product distributions. Our upper bound improves upon the previous bound of $\exp(\widetilde{O}(\min\{\frac{k}{\varepsilon^2}\sqrt{d},d\}))$ by Harms-Yoshida (ICALP 2022) for Boolean functions ($r=2$). "

A common strategy is to rely on knowledge graphs (KGs) such as ConceptNet, and to model the relation between two concepts as a set of paths. However, KGs are limited to a fixed set of relation types, and they are incomplete and often noisy. Another strategy is to distill relation embeddings from a fine-tuned language model. However, this is less suitable for words that are only indirectly related and it does not readily allow us to incorporate structured domain knowledge. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We model relations as paths but associate their edges with relation embeddings. The paths are obtained by first identifying suitable intermediate words and then selecting those words for which informative relation embeddings can be obtained. We empirically show that our proposed representations are useful for solving hard analogy questions. "

Traditional methods for sensor placement involve exact, approximation, or heuristic approaches, with the latter being the most widely used. However, heuristic methods are limited by expert intuition and experience. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising approach for generating heuristic algorithms automatically. In this paper, we introduce a novel sensor placement approach focused on learning improvement heuristics using deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Our approach leverages an RL formulation for learning improvement heuristics, driven by an actor-critic algorithm for training the policy network. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art approaches by conducting comprehensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach in producing high-quality solutions. Our work presents a promising direction for applying advanced DL and RL techniques to challenging climate sensor placement problems. "

By tackling the video instance segmentation tasks through effective analysis and utilization of visual information in videos, a range of computer vision-enabled applications (e.g., human action recognition, medical image processing, autonomous vehicle navigation, surveillance, etc) can be implemented. As deep-learning techniques take a dominant role in various computer vision areas, a plethora of deep-learning-based video instance segmentation schemes have been proposed. This survey offers a multifaceted view of deep-learning schemes for video instance segmentation, covering various architectural paradigms, along with comparisons of functional performance, model complexity, and computational overheads. In addition to the common architectural designs, auxiliary techniques for improving the performance of deep-learning models for video instance segmentation are compiled and discussed.

For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves sampling times competitive with neural SGMs while running on consumer-grade CPUs. "

While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples, a wide spread belief in their iterative self-critique capabilities persists. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting of LLMs in the context of Graph Coloring, a canonical NP-complete reasoning problem that is related to propositional satisfiability as well as practical problems like scheduling and allocation. We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT4 in solving graph coloring instances or verifying the correctness of candidate colorings. In iterative modes, we experiment with the model critiquing its own answers and an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions. In both cases, we analyze whether the content of the criticisms actually affects bottom line performance. The study seems to indicate that (i) LLMs are bad at solving graph coloring instances (ii) they are no better at verifying a solution--and thus are not effective in iterative modes with LLMs critiquing LLM-generated solutions (iii) the correctness and content of the criticisms--whether by LLMs or external solvers--seems largely irrelevant to the performance of iterative prompting. We show that the observed increase in effectiveness is largely due to the correct solution being fortuitously present in the top-k completions of the prompt (and being recognized as such by an external verifier). Our results thus call into question claims about the self-critiquing capabilities of state of the art LLMs. "

However, there are security and privacy concerns because smart city applications collect large amounts of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles. Anonymization, which generalizes data and reduces data uniqueness is an important step in preserving the privacy of sensitive information. However, anonymization methods frequently require large datasets and rely on untrusted third parties to collect and manage data, particularly in a cloud environment. In this case, private data leakage remains a critical issue, discouraging users from sharing their data and impeding the advancement of smart city services. This problem can be solved if the computational entity can perform the anonymization process without obtaining the original plain text. This study proposed a hierarchical k-anonymization framework using homomorphic encryption and secret sharing composed of two types of domains. Different computing methods are selected flexibly, and two domains are connected hierarchically to obtain higher-level anonymization results in an efficient manner. The experimental results show that connecting two domains can accelerate the anonymization process, indicating that the proposed secure hierarchical architecture is practical and efficient. "

Çatalyürek",New submissions,"Machine Learning (cs.LG); Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)","Significant computational resources are required to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) at a large scale, and the process is highly data-intensive. One of the most effective ways to reduce resource requirements is minibatch training coupled with graph sampling. GNNs have the unique property that items in a minibatch have overlapping data. However, the commonly implemented Independent Minibatching approach assigns each Processing Element (PE) its own minibatch to process, leading to duplicated computations and input data access across PEs. This amplifies the Neighborhood Explosion Phenomenon (NEP), which is the main bottleneck limiting scaling. To reduce the effects of NEP in the multi-PE setting, we propose a new approach called Cooperative Minibatching. Our approach capitalizes on the fact that the size of the sampled subgraph is a concave function of the batch size, leading to significant reductions in the amount of work per seed vertex as batch sizes increase. Hence, it is favorable for processors equipped with a fast interconnect to work on a large minibatch together as a single larger processor, instead of working on separate smaller minibatches, even though global batch size is identical. We also show how to take advantage of the same phenomenon in serial execution by generating dependent consecutive minibatches. Our experimental evaluations show up to 4x bandwidth savings for fetching vertex embeddings, by simply increasing this dependency without harming model convergence. Combining our proposed approaches, we achieve up to 64% speedup over Independent Minibatching on single-node multi-GPU systems. "

The system uses a large language model to interpret user intentions and select appropriate AI models for task execution. Each backend model is specialized for a specific task, and their outputs are aggregated to meet the user's requirements. To ensure musical coherence, essential attributes are maintained in a centralized table. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, highlighting its utility not only in facilitating music creation but also its potential for broader applications.

Leveraging the range-Doppler spectra information, we identify the measurement classes, which serve as additional information to enhance clutter rejection and data association, thus bolstering the robustness of target tracking. We first introduce a novel neural enhanced message passing approach, where the beliefs obtained by the unified message passing are fed into the neural network as additional information. The output beliefs are then utilized to refine the original beliefs. Then, we propose a classification-aided robust multiple target tracking algorithm, employing the neural enhanced message passing technique. This algorithm is comprised of three modules: a message-passing module, a neural network module, and a Dempster-Shafer module. The message-passing module is used to represent the statistical model by the factor graph and infers target kinematic states, visibility states, and data associations based on the spatial measurement information. The neural network module is employed to extract features from range-Doppler spectra and derive beliefs on whether a measurement is target-generated or clutter-generated. The Dempster-Shafer module is used to fuse the beliefs obtained from both the factor graph and the neural network. As a result, our proposed algorithm adopts a model-and-data-driven framework, effectively enhancing clutter suppression and data association, leading to significant improvements in multiple target tracking performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real data scenarios, demonstrating its capability to handle challenging tracking scenarios in practical radar applications. "

Additionally, the filter is flexible in the total number of sensors used while leveraging the commonly used MSCKF framework for camera measurements. The filter framework has been validated using Monte Carlo simulation as well as experimentally. In both simulations and experiments, using multiple IMU measurement streams within the proposed filter framework outperforms the use of a single IMU in a filter prediction step while also producing consistent and accurate estimates of initial calibration errors. Compared to current state-of-the-art optimizers, the filter produces similar intrinsic and extrinsic calibration parameters for each sensor.

This community has long been plagued by two challenges: 1) The effectiveness of division is still far from promising. Existing techniques only employ a limited source of run-time data (e.g., code coverage) to be failure proximity, which typically delivers unsatisfactory results. 2) The outcome can be hardly comprehensible. A developer who receives the failure indexing result does not know why all failures should be divided the way they are. This leads to difficulties for developers to be convinced by the result, which in turn affects the adoption of the results. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose SURE, a viSUalized failuRe indExing approach using the program memory spectrum. We first collect the run-time memory information at preset breakpoints during the execution of failed test cases, and transform it into human-friendly images (called program memory spectrum, PMS). Then, any pair of PMS images that serve as proxies for two failures is fed to a trained Siamese convolutional neural network, to predict the likelihood of them being triggered by the same fault. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SURE: It achieves 101.20% and 41.38% improvements in faults number estimation, as well as 105.20% and 35.53% improvements in clustering, compared with the state-of-the-art technique in this field, in simulated and real-world environments, respectively. Moreover, we carry out a human study to quantitatively evaluate the comprehensibility of PMS, revealing that this novel type of representation can help developers better comprehend failure indexing results.

Firstly, we develop a new coverage metric by maintaining extra virgin map for each covered target to track the coverage status of seeds that hit the target. This approach enables the storage of waypoints into the corpus that hit a target through interesting path, thus enriching the path diversity for each target. Additionally, we propose a corpus-level energy assignment strategy that guarantees fairness for each target. AFLRun starts with uniform target weight and propagates this weight to seeds to get a desired seed weight distribution. By assigning energy to each seed in the corpus according to such desired distribution, a precise and unbiased energy assignment can be achieved. We built a prototype system and assessed its performance using a standard benchmark and several extensively fuzzed real-world applications. The evaluation results demonstrate that AFLRun outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of vulnerability detection, both in quantity and speed. Moreover, AFLRun uncovers 29 previously unidentified vulnerabilities, including 8 CVEs, across four distinct programs. "

In this paper, we focus on gender bias and the problem of binary classification. We show that gender bias in the prediction model is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the causal model in mitigating gender bias by cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that the overall classification accuracy is improved slightly. Our novel approach is intuitive, easy-to-use, and can be implemented using existing statistical software tools such as ""lavaan"" in R. Hence, it enhances explainability and promotes trust. "

Based on varying dimension reduction ratios, our algorithm exhibits the capability to yield a high precision numerical solution for stochastic partial differential equations, or provides a rough representation of the exact solutions as a pre-processing phase. Meanwhile, our algorithm for solving stochastic optimal control problems allows a diverse range of gradient-based unconstrained optimization methods, rendering it particularly appealing for computationally intensive large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are conducted and the results provide strong validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm. "

Researchers have recently explored various methods to automatically repair declarative software specifications, such as template-based repair, feedback-driven iterative repair, and bounded exhaustive approaches. The latest developments in large language models provide new opportunities for the automatic repair of declarative specifications. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT to repair software specifications written in the Alloy declarative language. Unlike imperative languages, specifications in Alloy are not executed but rather translated into logical formulas and evaluated using backend constraint solvers to identify specification instances and counterexamples to assertions. Our evaluation focuses on ChatGPT's ability to improve the correctness and completeness of Alloy declarative specifications through automatic repairs. We analyze the results produced by ChatGPT and compare them with those of leading automatic Alloy repair methods. Our study revealed that while ChatGPT falls short in comparison to existing techniques, it was able to successfully repair bugs that no other technique could address. Our analysis also identified errors in ChatGPT's generated repairs, including improper operator usage, type errors, higher-order logic misuse, and relational arity mismatches. Additionally, we observed instances of hallucinations in ChatGPT-generated repairs and inconsistency in its results. Our study provides valuable insights for software practitioners, researchers, and tool builders considering ChatGPT for declarative specification repairs. "

Nevertheless, existing approaches relying on a single generic feedback source fail to address the diverse error types found in LM-generated reasoning chains. In this work, we propose Multi-Aspect Feedback, an iterative refinement framework that integrates multiple feedback modules, including frozen LMs and external tools, each focusing on a specific error category. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to addressing several errors in the LM-generated reasoning chain and thus improving the overall performance of an LM in several reasoning tasks. We see a relative improvement of up to 20% in Mathematical Reasoning and up to 18% in Logical Entailment. "

First, coverage performance of the downlink single-input-single-output system is investigated, and the closed-form expression of coverage probability is derived. Moreover, travel distance maximization problem is formulated to facilitate RIS discrete phase design and RIS placement optimization, which is subject to coverage probability constraint. Simulation results validate that better coverage performance and higher travel distance can be achieved with deployment of RIS. The impacts of some key system parameters including transmission power, signal-to-noise ratio threshold, number of RIS elements, number of RIS quantization bits, horizontal distance between base station and RIS, and speed of HST on system performance are investigated.

This works investigates whether it is possible to attack SAM with image-agnostic Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP). In other words, we seek a single perturbation that can fool the SAM to predict invalid masks for most (if not all) images. We demonstrate convetional image-centric attack framework is effective for image-independent attacks but fails for universal adversarial attack. To this end, we propose a novel perturbation-centric framework that results in a UAP generation method based on self-supervised contrastive learning (CL), where the UAP is set to the anchor sample and the positive sample is augmented from the UAP. The representations of negative samples are obtained from the image encoder in advance and saved in a memory bank. The effectiveness of our proposed CL-based UAP generation method is validated by both quantitative and qualitative results. On top of the ablation study to understand various components in our proposed method, we shed light on the roles of positive and negative samples in making the generated UAP effective for attacking SAM.

Orthogonal to prior work handling accident-prone traffic events by algorithm designs at the policy level, we investigate a Closed-loop Adversarial Training (CAT) framework for safe end-to-end driving in this paper through the lens of environment augmentation. CAT aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by training the agent on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated over time. A novel resampling technique is developed to turn log-replay real-world driving scenarios into safety-critical ones via probabilistic factorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is modeled as the multiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently, CAT can launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical scenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost in the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive simulator and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported from real-world driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can effectively generate adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained. After training, the agent can achieve superior driving safety in both log-replay and safety-critical traffic scenarios on the held-out test set.

For large plaintext, to evaluate a general function homomorphically over a ciphertext, in the FHEW/TFHE approach, since the function in look-up table form is encoded in the coefficients of a test polynomial, the degree of the polynomial must be high enough to hold the entire table. This increases the bootstrapping time complexity and memory cost, as the size of bootstrapping keys and keyswitching keys need to be large accordingly. In this paper, we propose to encode the look-up table of any function in a polynomial vector, whose coefficients can hold more data. The corresponding representation of the additive group Zq used in the RGSW-based bootstrapping is the group of monic monomial permutation matrices, which integrates the permutation matrix representation used by Alperin-Sheriff and Peikert in 2014, and the monic monomial representation used in the FHEW/TFHE scheme. We make comprehensive investigation of the new representation, and propose a new bootstrapping algorithm based on it. The new algorithm has the prominent benefit of small bootstrapping key size and small key-switching key size, which leads to polynomial factor improvement in key size, in addition to constant factor improvement in run-time cost.

These models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost - quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest. "

In such few-shot setting, we revisit the sparse retrieval method, and propose an ELECTRA-based keyword extractor to denoise the mention context and construct a better query expression. For training the extractor, we propose a distant supervision method to automatically generate training data based on overlapping tokens between mention contexts and entity descriptions. Experimental results on the ZESHEL dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin across all test domains, showing the effectiveness of keyword-enhanced sparse retrieval.

The goal of EIT is to uncover the information transmission mechanisms from an electromagnetic (EM) perspective in wireless systems. Existing works on EIT are mainly focused on the analysis of degrees-of-freedom (DoF), system capacity, and characteristics of the electromagnetic channel. However, these works do not clarify how EIT can improve wireless communication systems. To answer this question, in this paper, we provide a novel demonstration of the application of EIT. By integrating EM knowledge into the classical MMSE channel estimator, we observe for the first time that EIT is capable of improving the channel estimation performace. Specifically, the EM knowledge is first encoded into a spatio-temporal correlation function (STCF), which we term as the EM kernel. This EM kernel plays the role of side information to the channel estimator. Since the EM kernel takes the form of Gaussian processes (GP), we propose the EIT-based Gaussian process regression (EIT-GPR) to derive the channel estimations. In addition, since the EM kernel allows parameter tuning, we propose EM kernel learning to fit the EM kernel to channel observations. Simulation results show that the application of EIT to the channel estimator enables it to outperform traditional isotropic MMSE algorithm, thus proving the practical values of EIT. "

Previous methods largely focus on the candidate retrieval stage and ignore the essential candidate ranking stage, which disambiguates among entities and makes the final linking prediction. In this paper, we propose a read-and-select (ReS) framework by modeling the main components of entity disambiguation, i.e., mention-entity matching and cross-entity comparison. First, for each candidate, the reading module leverages mention context to output mention-aware entity representations, enabling mention-entity matching. Then, in the selecting module, we frame the choice of candidates as a sequence labeling problem, and all candidate representations are fused together to enable cross-entity comparison. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the established zero-shot EL dataset ZESHEL with a 2.55\% micro-average accuracy gain, with no need for laborious multi-phase pre-training used in most of the previous work, showing the effectiveness of both mention-entity and cross-entity interaction.

Carreon-Rascon, Xiwen Chen, Geng Yuan, Ao Li",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Medical time series data are indispensable in healthcare, providing critical insights for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. The exponential growth in data complexity, driven by advanced sensor technologies, has presented challenges related to data labeling. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges, eliminating the need for extensive human annotation. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for Medical Time Series Representation Learning, known as MTS-LOF. MTS-LOF leverages the strengths of contrastive learning and Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods, offering a unique approach to representation learning for medical time series data. By combining these techniques, MTS-LOF enhances the potential of healthcare applications by providing more sophisticated, context-rich representations. Additionally, MTS-LOF employs a multi-masking strategy to facilitate occlusion-invariant feature learning. This approach allows the model to create multiple views of the data by masking portions of it. By minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of these masked patches and the fully visible patches, MTS-LOF learns to capture rich contextual information within medical time series datasets. The results of experiments conducted on diverse medical time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of MTS-LOF over other methods. These findings hold promise for significantly enhancing healthcare applications by improving representation learning. Furthermore, our work delves into the integration of joint-embedding SSL and MAE techniques, shedding light on the intricate interplay between temporal and structural dependencies in healthcare data. This understanding is crucial, as it allows us to grasp the complexities of healthcare data analysis. "

Most current FSS methods follow the paradigm of mining the semantics from the support images to guide the query image segmentation. However, such a pattern of `learning from others' struggles to handle the extreme intra-class variation, preventing FSS from being directly generalized to remote sensing scenes. To bridge the gap of intra-class variance, we develop a Dual-Mining network named DMNet for cross-image mining and self-mining, meaning that it no longer focuses solely on support images but pays more attention to the query image itself. Specifically, we propose a Class-public Region Mining (CPRM) module to effectively suppress irrelevant feature pollution by capturing the common semantics between the support-query image pair. The Class-specific Region Mining (CSRM) module is then proposed to continuously mine the class-specific semantics of the query image itself in a `filtering' and `purifying' manner. In addition, to prevent the co-existence of multiple classes in remote sensing scenes from exacerbating the collapse of FSS generalization, we also propose a new Known-class Meta Suppressor (KMS) module to suppress the activation of known-class objects in the sample. Extensive experiments on the iSAID and LoveDA remote sensing datasets have demonstrated that our method sets the state-of-the-art with a minimum number of model parameters. Significantly, our model with the backbone of Resnet-50 achieves the mIoU of 49.58% and 51.34% on iSAID under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by 1.8% and 1.12%, respectively.

Consequently, designing a white-box model to compute metrics that reflect the presence of specific internal relations in these vectors has become a common approach for post-hoc interpretability analysis of pretrained language models. However, achieving interpretability in white-box models and ensuring the rigor of metric computation becomes challenging when the source model lacks inherent interpretability. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss striking a balance in this trade-off and propose a novel line to constructing metrics for understanding the mechanisms of pretrained language models. We have specifically designed a family of metrics along this line of investigation, and the model used to compute these metrics is referred to as the tree topological probe. We conducted measurements on BERT-large by using these metrics. Based on the experimental results, we propose a speculation regarding the working mechanism of BERT-like pretrained language models, as well as a strategy for enhancing fine-tuning performance by leveraging the topological probe to improve specific submodules.

In this paper, we propose a novel fully end-to-end retrieval paradigm. It can not only end-to-end learn the best docids for existing and new documents automatically via a semantic indexing module, but also perform end-to-end document retrieval via an encoder-decoder-based generative model, namely Auto Search Indexer (ASI). Besides, we design a reparameterization mechanism to combine the above two modules into a joint optimization framework.

In this way, node embeddings produced at the output layer dually serve as both predictive features for solving downstream tasks (e.g., node classification) and energy function minimizers that inherit desirable inductive biases and interpretability. However, scaling GNN architectures constructed in this way remains challenging, in part because the convergence of the forward pass may involve models with considerable depth. To tackle this limitation, we propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, guided by convergence guarantees in certain settings.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no theoretical analysis on how well the group convolution approximates the standard convolution. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the approximation of the group convolution to the standard convolution with respect to the number of groups. Furthermore, we propose a novel variant of the group convolution called balanced group convolution, which shows a higher approximation with a small additional computational cost. We provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superior performance of the balanced group convolution over other variants of group convolution. "

Our network is modular by design and optimized for all aspects of both the panoptic segmentation and tracking task. One of the core components of our network is the object instance detection branch, which we train using point-level (modal) annotations, as available in segmentation-centric datasets.

However, the limited size, diversity, and balance of existing weed datasets hinder the development of deep learning models for generalizable weed identification. In addition, the expensive labelling requirements of mainstream fully-supervised weed classifiers make them cost- and time-prohibitive to deploy widely, for new weed species, and in site-specific weed management. This paper proposes a novel method for Weed Contrastive Learning through visual Representations (WeedCLR), that uses class-optimized loss with Von Neumann Entropy of deep representation for weed classification in long-tailed datasets. WeedCLR leverages self-supervised learning to learn rich and robust visual features without any labels and applies a class-optimized loss function to address the class imbalance problem in long-tailed datasets. WeedCLR is evaluated on two public weed datasets: CottonWeedID15, containing 15 weed species, and DeepWeeds, containing 8 weed species. WeedCLR achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.3\% on CottonWeedID15 and 5.6\% on DeepWeeds over previous methods. It also demonstrates better generalization ability and robustness to different environmental conditions than existing methods without the need for expensive and time-consuming human annotations. These significant improvements make WeedCLR an effective tool for weed classification in long-tailed datasets and allows for more rapid and widespread deployment of site-specific weed management and crop intervention technologies.

While recent large language models show remarkable advances in inference tasks, their performance in inductive reasoning, where not all information is present in the context, is far behind deductive reasoning. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the models based on the task difficulty defined by the semantic information gap -- which distinguishes inductive and deductive reasoning (Johnson-Laird, 1988, 1993). Our analysis reveals that the disparity in information between dialogue contexts and desired inferences poses a significant challenge to the inductive inference process. To mitigate this information gap, we investigate a contrastive learning approach by feeding negative samples. Our experiments suggest negative samples help models understand what is wrong and improve their inference generations. "

McMahan",New submissions,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Multimedia (cs.MM),"Point clouds are a 3D space representation of an environment that was recorded with a high precision laser scanner. These scanners can suffer from environmental interference such as surface shading, texturing, and reflections. Because of this, point clouds may be contaminated with fake or incorrect colors. Current open source or proprietary tools offer limited or no access to correcting these visual errors automatically. RecolorCloud is a tool developed to resolve these color conflicts by utilizing automated color recoloring. We offer the ability to deleting or recoloring outlier points automatically with users only needing to specify bounding box regions to effect colors. Results show a vast improvement of the photo-realistic quality of large point clouds. Additionally, users can quickly recolor a point cloud with set semantic segmentation colors. "

Recent advancements have aimed to overcome this constraint by harnessing image generative models, pretrained on extensive curated web datasets, using knowledge transfer techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Efficiently addressing the requirements of high-resolution rendering often necessitates the adoption of latent representation-based models, such as the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). In this framework, a significant challenge arises: To compute gradients for individual image pixels, it is necessary to backpropagate gradients from the designated latent space through the frozen components of the image model, such as the VAE encoder used within LDM. However, this gradient propagation pathway has never been optimized, remaining uncontrolled during training. We find that the unregulated gradients adversely affect the 3D model's capacity in acquiring texture-related information from the image generative model, leading to poor quality appearance synthesis. To address this overarching challenge, we propose an innovative operation termed Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping (PGC) designed for seamless integration into existing 3D generative models, thereby enhancing their synthesis quality. Specifically, we control the magnitude of stochastic gradients by clipping the pixel-wise gradients efficiently, while preserving crucial texture-related gradient directions. Despite this simplicity and minimal extra cost, extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our PGC in enhancing the performance of existing 3D generative models for high-resolution object rendering.

Adams",New submissions,Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Robotic collectives for military and disaster response applications require coalition formation algorithms to partition robots into appropriate task teams. Collectives' missions will often incorporate tasks that require multiple high-level robot behaviors or services, which coalition formation must accommodate. The highly dynamic and unstructured application domains also necessitate that coalition formation algorithms produce near optimal solutions (i.e., >95% utility) in near real-time (i.e., <5 minutes) with very large collectives (i.e., hundreds of robots). No previous coalition formation algorithm satisfies these requirements. An initial evaluation found that traditional auction-based algorithms' runtimes are too long, even though the centralized simulator incorporated ideal conditions unlikely to occur in real-world deployments (i.e., synchronization across robots and perfect, instantaneous communication). The hedonic game-based GRAPE algorithm can produce solutions in near real-time, but cannot be applied to multiple service collectives. This manuscript integrates GRAPE and a services model, producing GRAPE-S and Pair-GRAPE-S. These algorithms and two auction baselines were evaluated using a centralized simulator with up to 1000 robots, and via the largest distributed coalition formation simulated evaluation to date, with up to 500 robots. The evaluations demonstrate that auctions transfer poorly to distributed collectives, resulting in excessive runtimes and low utility solutions. GRAPE-S satisfies the target domains' coalition formation requirements, producing near optimal solutions in near real-time, and Pair-GRAPE-S more than satisfies the domain requirements, producing optimal solutions in near real-time. GRAPE-S and Pair-GRAPE-S are the first algorithms demonstrated to support near real-time coalition formation for very large, distributed collectives with multiple services. "

Lyu",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"In this paper, we identify a cultural dominance issue within large language models (LLMs) due to the predominant use of English data in model training (e.g. ChatGPT). LLMs often provide inappropriate English-culture-related answers that are not relevant to the expected culture when users ask in non-English languages. To systematically evaluate the cultural dominance issue, we build a benchmark that consists of both concrete (e.g. holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g. values and opinions) cultural objects. Empirical results show that the representative GPT models suffer from the culture dominance problem, where GPT-4 is the most affected while text-davinci-003 suffers the least from this problem. Our study emphasizes the need for critical examination of cultural dominance and ethical consideration in their development and deployment. We show two straightforward methods in model development (i.e. pretraining on more diverse data) and deployment (e.g. culture-aware prompting) can significantly mitigate the cultural dominance issue in LLMs. "

Among them, attention-based neural operators have become one of the mainstreams in related research. However, existing approaches overfit the limited training data due to the considerable number of parameters in the attention mechanism. To address this, we develop an orthogonal attention based on the eigendecomposition of the kernel integral operator and the neural approximation of eigenfunctions. The orthogonalization naturally poses a proper regularization effect on the resulting neural operator, which aids in resisting overfitting and boosting generalization. Experiments on six standard neural operator benchmark datasets comprising both regular and irregular geometries show that our method can outperform competing baselines with decent margins. "

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of pre-trained language models to accurately classify responses from Doctors and AI in health consultations through zero-shot learning. Our study aims to determine whether these models can effectively detect if a text originates from human or AI models without specific corpus training. For our experiments, we collected responses from doctors to patient inquiries about their health and posed the same question/response to AI models. Our findings revealed that while pre-trained language models demonstrate a strong understanding of language generally, they may require specific corpus training or other techniques to achieve accurate classification of doctor- and AI-generated text in healthcare consultations. As a baseline approach, this study shows the limitations of relying solely on zero-shot classification in medical classification tasks. This research lays the groundwork for further research into the field of medical text classification, informing the development of more effective approaches to accurately classify doctor- and AI-generated text in health consultations.

Our experiments conducted on three extrinsic bias benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Co$^2$PT on bias mitigation during the prompt tuning process and its adaptability to existing upstream debiased language models. These findings indicate the strength of Co$^2$PT and provide promising avenues for further enhancement in bias mitigation on downstream tasks. "

Volume leakage, coupled with prior knowledge about data distribution and/or previously executed queries, can reveal both ciphertexts and current user queries. We develop a solution to prevent volume leakage, entitled Veil, that partitions the dataset by randomly mapping keys to a set of equi-sized buckets. Veil provides a tunable mechanism for data owners to explore a trade-off between storage and communication overheads. To make buckets indistinguishable to the adversary, Veil uses a novel padding strategy that allow buckets to overlap, reducing the need to add fake records. Both theoretical and experimental results show Veil to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art. "

Traditional evaluation strategies often fall short due to the complex, adaptive and dynamic nature of society. While reinforcement learning (RL) can be a powerful approach for optimizing decisions in dynamic settings, the difficulty of realistic environment design remains a barrier to building robust agents that perform well in practical settings. To address this issue we tap into the field of system dynamics (SD) as a complementary method that incorporates collaborative simulation model specification practices. We introduce SDGym, a low-code library built on the OpenAI Gym framework which enables the generation of custom RL environments based on SD simulation models. Through a feasibility study we validate that well specified, rich RL environments can be generated from preexisting SD models and a few lines of configuration code. We demonstrate the capabilities of the SDGym environment using an SD model of the electric vehicle adoption problem. We compare two SD simulators, PySD and BPTK-Py for parity, and train a D4PG agent using the Acme framework to showcase learning and environment interaction. Our preliminary findings underscore the dual potential of SD to improve RL environment design and for RL to improve dynamic policy discovery within SD models. By open-sourcing SDGym, the intent is to galvanize further research and promote adoption across the SD and RL communities, thereby catalyzing collaboration in this emerging interdisciplinary space. "

Specifically, considering the impressive capabilities of newly emerged LLMs, we propose an attack framework to instruct LLMs to mimic human-generated prompts through in-context learning. Furthermore, we propose a defense framework that fine-tunes victim LLMs through iterative interactions with the attack framework to enhance their safety against red teaming attacks. Extensive experiments on different LLMs validate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense frameworks.

However, existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often grapple with limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight saliency' in MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation. This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the forgetting dataset). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first principled MU approach adaptable enough to effectively erase the influence of forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and generation. For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy, outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion and Forget-Me-Not.

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN), \textit{WeaveNet}, designed for bipartite graphs. Since a bipartite graph is generally dense, general GNN architectures lose node-wise information by over-smoothing when deeply stacked. Such a phenomenon is undesirable for solving matching problems. WeaveNet avoids it by preserving edge-wise information while passing messages densely to reach a better solution. To evaluate the model, we approximated one of the \textit{strongly NP-hard} problems, \textit{fair stable matching}. Despite its inherent difficulties and the network's general purpose design, our model reached a comparative performance with state-of-the-art algorithms specially designed for stable matching for small numbers of agents.

Inspired by adversarial machine learning, this paper aims to develop a method of automatically generating evaluation data by appropriately modifying existing data on which LLMs behave faithfully. Specifically, this paper presents AutoDebug, an LLM-based framework to use prompting chaining to generate transferable adversarial attacks in the form of question-answering examples. We seek to understand the extent to which these examples trigger the hallucination behaviors of LLMs. We implement AutoDebug using ChatGPT and evaluate the resulting two variants of a popular open-domain question-answering dataset, Natural Questions (NQ), on a collection of open-source and proprietary LLMs under various prompting settings. Our generated evaluation data is human-readable and, as we show, humans can answer these modified questions well. Nevertheless, we observe pronounced accuracy drops across multiple LLMs including GPT-4. Our experimental results show that LLMs are likely to hallucinate in two categories of question-answering scenarios where (1) there are conflicts between knowledge given in the prompt and their parametric knowledge, or (2) the knowledge expressed in the prompt is complex. Finally, we find that the adversarial examples generated by our method are transferable across all considered LLMs. The examples generated by a small model can be used to debug a much larger model, making our approach cost-effective.

However, these analyses often focus on evaluating the performance of each modality in isolation, lacking insights into their cross-modal interactions. Specifically, questions concerning whether these vision-language models execute vision and language tasks consistently or independently have remained unanswered.

This article proposes the conceptual model called PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two main components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data curation/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the private training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its applicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the existing model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we employed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or randomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively evaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of public database and resources, during each update when new information is added for training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy for private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain, private information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures such as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy vs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and obfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely, the use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational complexity and high training latency. We believe that the proposed model could be used as a benchmark for proposing privacy preserving LLMs for generative AI tools. "

User interaction with a retrieved item is highly dependent on the item's position in the layout, and users do not provide similar attention to every position in ranking (under any layout model). User attention is an important component in the evaluation process of ranking, due to its use in effectiveness metrics that estimate utility as well as fairness metrics that evaluate ranking based on social and ethical concerns. These metrics take user browsing behavior into account in their measurement strategies to estimate the attention the user is likely to provide to each item in ranking. Research on understanding user browsing behavior has proposed several user browsing models, and further observed that user browsing behavior differs with different ranking layouts. However, the underlying concepts of these browsing models are often similar, including varying components and parameter settings. We seek to leverage that similarity to represent multiple browsing models in a generalized, configurable framework which can be further extended to more complex ranking scenarios. In this paper, we describe a probabilistic user browsing model for linear rankings, show how they can be configured to yield models commonly used in current evaluation practice, and generalize this model to also account for browsing behaviors in grid-based layouts. This model provides configurable framework for estimating the attention that results from user browsing activity for a range of IR evaluation and measurement applications in multiple formats, and also identifies parameters that need to be estimated through user studies to provide realistic evaluation beyond ranked lists.

However, most of the existing BO methods aim to learn the optimal solution, which may become infeasible when the parameter space is extremely large or the problem is time-sensitive. In these contexts, switching to a satisficing solution that requires less information can result in better performance. In this work, we focus on time-sensitive black-box optimization problems and propose satisficing Thompson sampling-based parallel Bayesian optimization (STS-PBO) approaches, including synchronous and asynchronous versions. We shift the target from an optimal solution to a satisficing solution that is easier to learn. The rate-distortion theory is introduced to construct a loss function that balances the amount of information that needs to be learned with sub-optimality, and the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is adopted to compute the target solution that reaches the minimum information rate under the distortion limit at each step. Both discounted and undiscounted Bayesian cumulative regret bounds are theoretically derived for the proposed STS-PBO approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated on a fast-charging design problem of Lithium-ion batteries. The results are accordant with theoretical analyses, and show that our STS-PBO methods outperform both sequential counterparts and parallel BO with traditional Thompson sampling in both synchronous and asynchronous settings.

Whether scientists are conducting fundamental research or refining practical applications, they typically assess and rank classification techniques based on performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. However, reported performance scores may not always serve as a reliable basis for research ranking. This can be attributed to undisclosed or unconventional practices related to cross-validation, typographical errors, and other factors. In a given experimental setup, with a specific number of positive and negative test items, most performance scores can assume specific, interrelated values. In this paper, we introduce numerical techniques to assess the consistency of reported performance scores and the assumed experimental setup. Importantly, the proposed approach does not rely on statistical inference but uses numerical methods to identify inconsistencies with certainty. Through three different applications related to medicine, we demonstrate how the proposed techniques can effectively detect inconsistencies, thereby safeguarding the integrity of research fields. To benefit the scientific community, we have made the consistency tests available in an open-source Python package. "

To overcome this obstacle, we propose ICU, Image Caption Understanding, which divides a V&L task into two stages: a V&L model performs image captioning in English, and a multilingual language model (mLM), in turn, takes the caption as the alt text and performs crosslingual language understanding. The burden of multilingual processing is lifted off V&L model and placed on mLM. Since the multilingual text data is relatively of higher abundance and quality, ICU can facilitate the conquering of language barriers for V&L models. In experiments on two tasks across 9 languages in the IGLUE benchmark, we show that ICU can achieve new state-of-the-art results for five languages, and comparable results for the rest. "

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 145,Fully Onboard Low-Power Localization with Semantic Sensor Fusion on a  Nano-UAV using Floor Plans,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12536,"Nicky Zimmerman, Hanna Müller, Michele Magno, Luca Benini",New submissions,Robotics (cs.RO),"Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are well-fit for indoor applications and for close proximity to humans. To enable autonomy, the nano-UAV must be able to self-localize in its operating environment. This is a particularly-challenging task due to the limited sensing and compute resources on board. This work presents an online and onboard approach for localization in floor plans annotated with semantic information. Unlike sensor-based maps, floor plans are readily-available, and do not increase the cost and time of deployment. To overcome the difficulty of localizing in sparse maps, the proposed approach fuses geometric information from miniaturized time-of-flight sensors and semantic cues. The semantic information is extracted from images by deploying a state-of-the-art object detection model on a high-performance multi-core microcontroller onboard the drone, consuming only 2.5mJ per frame and executing in 38ms. In our evaluation, we globally localize in a real-world office environment, achieving 90% success rate. We also release an open-source implementation of our work. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 146,Product Attribute Value Extraction using Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12537,"Alexander Brinkmann, Roee Shraga, Christian Bizer",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"E-commerce applications such as faceted product search or product comparison are based on structured product descriptions like attribute/value pairs. The vendors on e-commerce platforms do not provide structured product descriptions but describe offers using titles or descriptions. To process such offers, it is necessary to extract attribute/value pairs from textual product attributes. State-of-the-art attribute/value extraction techniques rely on pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT. Two major drawbacks of these models for attribute/value extraction are that (i) the models require significant amounts of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models face challenges in generalizing to attribute values not included in the training data. This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as a training data-efficient and robust alternative to PLM-based attribute/value extraction methods. We consider hosted LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as open-source LLMs based on Llama2. We evaluate the models in a zero-shot scenario and in a scenario where task-specific training data is available. In the zero-shot scenario, we compare various prompt designs for representing information about the target attributes of the extraction. In the scenario with training data, we investigate (i) the provision of example attribute values, (ii) the selection of in-context demonstrations, and (iii) the fine-tuning of GPT-3.5. Our experiments show that GPT-4 achieves an average F1-score of 85% on the two evaluation datasets while the best PLM-based techniques perform on average 5% worse using the same amount of training data. GPT-4 achieves a 10% higher F1-score than the best open-source LLM. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model reaches a similar performance as GPT-4 while being significantly more cost-efficient. "

Although data-driven evolutionary optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO) approaches have shown promise in solving expensive optimization problems in static environments, the attempts to develop such approaches in dynamic environments remain rarely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning-based optimization framework for solving expensive dynamic optimization problems. This framework is flexible, allowing any off-the-shelf continuously differentiable surrogate model to be used in a plug-in manner, either in data-driven evolutionary optimization or BO approaches. In particular, the framework consists of two unique components: 1) the meta-learning component, in which a gradient-based meta-learning approach is adopted to learn experience (effective model parameters) across different dynamics along the optimization process. 2) the adaptation component, where the learned experience (model parameters) is used as the initial parameters for fast adaptation in the dynamic environment based on few shot samples. By doing so, the optimization process is able to quickly initiate the search in a new environment within a strictly restricted computational budget. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm framework compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on common benchmark test problems under different dynamic characteristics.

And, moreover, that this embedding is conservative under termination hypothesis. "

Many MOEAs have been proposed in the past decades, of which the operators need carefully handcrafted design with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace the manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g., neural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing and training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well to solve new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel approach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA operators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM serve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a zero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further design an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version of decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO. Experimental studies on different test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive performance with widely used MOEAs. It is also promising to see the operator only learned from a few instances can have robust generalization performance on unseen problems with quite different patterns and settings. The results reveal the potential benefits of using pre-trained LLMs in the design of MOEAs. "

We also provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of our algorithm. To obtain our main results, we consider a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. We show that the PDE under consideration has a unique viscosity solution which coincides with the first component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Moreover, if the PDE admits a strong solution, then the gradient of the unique solution of the PDE coincides with the second component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. "

While robots capable of recognizing personal objects like ""my wallet"" can interact more naturally with non-expert users, current LCRG systems primarily limit robots to understanding only generic expressions. To this end, we introduce a task scenario GraspMine with a novel dataset that aims to locate and grasp personal objects given personal indicators via learning from a single human-robot interaction. To address GraspMine, we propose Personalized Grasping Agent (PGA), that learns personal objects by propagating user-given information through a Reminiscence-a collection of raw images from the user's environment. Specifically, PGA acquires personal object information by a user presenting a personal object with its associated indicator, followed by PGA inspecting the object by rotating it. Based on the acquired information, PGA pseudo-labels objects in the Reminiscence by our proposed label propagation algorithm. Harnessing the information acquired from the interactions and the pseudo-labeled objects in the Reminiscence, PGA adapts the object grounding model to grasp personal objects. Experiments on GraspMine show that PGA significantly outperforms baseline methods both in offline and online settings, signifying its effectiveness and personalization applicability on real-world scenarios. Finally, qualitative analysis shows the effectiveness of PGA through a detailed investigation of results in each phase. "

Few works have managed to achieve both real-time and accurate performance for vascular intervention robots. This work bridges high-accuracy 3D-2D registration techniques and computational efficiency requirements in intervention robot applications. We categorize centerline-based vascular 3D-2D image registration problems as an iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem and propose to use the Levenberg-Marquardt solver on the Lie manifold. Then, the recently developed Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) algorithm is introduced to overcome the ``big-to-small'' problem in typical robotic scenarios. Finally, an iterative reweighted least squares is applied to solve RKHS-based formulation efficiently. Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm processes registration over 50 Hz (rigid) and 20 Hz (nonrigid) and obtains competing registration accuracy similar to other works. Results indicate that our Iterative PnP is suitable for future vascular intervention robot applications. "

To improve the faithfulness, we propose insertion/deletion metric-aware explanation-based optimization (ID-ExpO), which optimizes differentiable predictors to improve both insertion and deletion scores of the explanations while keeping their predictive accuracy. Since the original insertion and deletion metrics are indifferentiable with respect to the explanations and directly unavailable for gradient-based optimization, we extend the metrics to be differentiable and use them to formalize insertion and deletion metric-based regularizers. The experimental results on image and tabular datasets show that the deep neural networks-based predictors fine-tuned using ID-ExpO enable popular post-hoc explainers to produce more faithful and easy-to-interpret explanations while keeping high predictive accuracy.

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 154,GMEM: Generalized Memory Management for Peripheral Devices,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12554,"Weixi Zhu, Alan L. Cox, Scott Rixner",New submissions,Operating Systems (cs.OS),"This paper presents GMEM, generalized memory management, for peripheral devices. GMEM provides OS support for centralized memory management of both CPU and devices. GMEM provides a high-level interface that decouples MMU-specific functions. Device drivers can thus attach themselves to a process's address space and let the OS take charge of their memory management. This eliminates the need for device drivers to ""reinvent the wheel"" and allows them to benefit from general memory optimizations integrated by GMEM. Furthermore, GMEM internally coordinates all attached devices within each virtual address space. This drastically improves user-level programmability, since programmers can use a single address space within their program, even when operating across the CPU and multiple devices. A case study on device drivers demonstrates these benefits. A GMEM-based IOMMU driver eliminates around seven hundred lines of code and obtains 54% higher network receive throughput utilizing 32% less CPU compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, the GMEM-based driver of a simulated GPU takes less than 70 lines of code, excluding its MMU functions. "

Interestingly, for large CPM-sizes, in comparison of the existing methods, this algorithm is the first approach which efficiently counts the cycles in the Tanner graphs of QC-LDPC codes. In fact, the algorithm recursively counts the cycles in the parity-check matrix column-by-column by finding all non-isomorph tailless backtrackless closed (TBC) walks in the base graph and enumerating theoretically their corresponding cycles in the same equivalent class. Moreover, this approach can be modified in few steps to find the cycle distributions of a class of LDPC codes based on Affine permutation matrices (APM-LDPC codes). Interestingly, unlike the existing methods which count the cycles up to $2g-2$, where $g$ is the girth, the proposed algorithm can be used to enumerate the cycles of arbitrary length in the Tanner graph. Moreover, the proposed cycle searching algorithm improves upon various previously known methods, in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements. "

Existing approaches for spatial reasoning typically infer spatial relations from pure text, which overlook the gap between natural language and symbolic structures. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have showcased exceptional proficiency in inducing and aggregating symbolic structures. However, classical GNNs face challenges in handling multi-hop spatial reasoning due to the over-smoothing issue, \textit{i.e.}, the performance decreases substantially as the number of graph layers increases. To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel \textbf{Dep}th-\textbf{Wi}se \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}eural \textbf{N}etwork (\textbf{DepWiGNN}). Specifically, we design a novel node memory scheme and aggregate the information over the depth dimension instead of the breadth dimension of the graph, which empowers the ability to collect long dependencies without stacking multiple layers. Experimental results on two challenging multi-hop spatial reasoning datasets show that DepWiGNN outperforms existing spatial reasoning methods. The comparisons with the other three GNNs further demonstrate its superiority in capturing long dependency in the graph. "

Their truthfulness and factuality are thus of great interest. To help users make the right decisions about the information they're getting, LLMs should not only provide but also help users fact-check information. In this paper, we conduct experiments with 80 crowdworkers in total to compare language models with search engines (information retrieval systems) at facilitating fact-checking by human users. We prompt LLMs to validate a given claim and provide corresponding explanations. Users reading LLM explanations are significantly more efficient than using search engines with similar accuracy. However, they tend to over-rely the LLMs when the explanation is wrong. To reduce over-reliance on LLMs, we ask LLMs to provide contrastive information - explain both why the claim is true and false, and then we present both sides of the explanation to users. This contrastive explanation mitigates users' over-reliance on LLMs, but cannot significantly outperform search engines. However, showing both search engine results and LLM explanations offers no complementary benefits as compared to search engines alone. Taken together, natural language explanations by LLMs may not be a reliable replacement for reading the retrieved passages yet, especially in high-stakes settings where over-relying on wrong AI explanations could lead to critical consequences.

For instance, deep networks trained on a large-scale face recognition dataset CelebA tend to predict blonde hair for females and black hair for males. Such biases not only jeopardize the robustness of models but also perpetuate and amplify social biases, which is especially concerning for automated decision-making processes in healthcare, recruitment, etc., as they could exacerbate unfair economic and social inequalities among different groups. Existing debiasing methods suffer from high costs in bias labeling or model re-training, while also exhibiting a deficiency in terms of elucidating the origins of biases within the model. To this respect, we propose a fast model debiasing framework (FMD) which offers an efficient approach to identify, evaluate and remove biases inherent in trained models. The FMD identifies biased attributes through an explicit counterfactual concept and quantifies the influence of data samples with influence functions. Moreover, we design a machine unlearning-based strategy to efficiently and effectively remove the bias in a trained model with a small counterfactual dataset. Experiments on the Colored MNIST, CelebA, and Adult Income datasets along with experiments with large language models demonstrate that our method achieves superior or competing accuracies compared with state-of-the-art methods while attaining significantly fewer biases and requiring much less debiasing cost. Notably, our method requires only a small external dataset and updating a minimal amount of model parameters, without the requirement of access to training data that may be too large or unavailable in practice.

We utilize Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods to recognize new classes and adapt existing non-graph OOD detection methods to graph data. Crucially, we suggest performing new class detection by combining OOD detection methods with information aggregated from the graph neighborhood. Most OOD detection methods avoid determining a crisp threshold for deciding whether a vertex is OOD. To tackle this problem, we propose a Weakly-supervised Relevance Feedback (Open-WRF) method, which decreases the sensitivity to thresholds in OOD detection. We evaluate our approach on six benchmark datasets. Our results show that the proposed neighborhood aggregation method for OOD scores outperforms existing methods independent of the underlying graph neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Open-WRF method is more robust to threshold selection and analyze the influence of graph neighborhood on OOD detection. The aggregation and threshold methods are compatible with arbitrary graph neural networks and OOD detection methods, making our approach versatile and applicable to many real-world applications. "

The primary objective of ML is to build models that can make accurate predictions on unseen data. Researchers aim to prove the existence of such generalizable models by evaluating performance using techniques such as cross-validation (CV), which uses systematic subsampling to estimate the generalization performance.

For example, political scientists have often used the left--right scale to systematically analyse political landscapes of different countries. NLP methods for automatic scaling analysis can find broad application provided they (i) are able to deal with long texts and (ii) work robustly across domains and languages. In this work, we implement and compare two approaches to automatic scaling analysis of political-party manifestos: label aggregation, a pipeline strategy relying on annotations of individual statements from the manifestos, and long-input-Transformer-based models, which compute scaling values directly from raw text. We carry out the analysis of the Comparative Manifestos Project dataset across 41 countries and 27 languages and find that the task can be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art models, with label aggregation producing the best results.

In this paper, we present a new pretraining framework for LMs that explicitly considers the topological and heterogeneous information in TAHGs. Firstly, we define a context graph as neighborhoods of a target node within specific orders and propose a topology-aware pretraining task to predict nodes involved in the context graph by jointly optimizing an LM and an auxiliary heterogeneous graph neural network. Secondly, based on the observation that some nodes are text-rich while others have little text, we devise a text augmentation strategy to enrich textless nodes with their neighbors' texts for handling the imbalance issue. We conduct link prediction and node classification tasks on three datasets from various domains.

A recent research shows that the empirical risk minimization~(ERM) over deep artificial neural networks overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of linear Kolmogorov PDEs with bounded initial functions. However, the initial functions may be unbounded in many applications such as the Black Scholes PDEs in pricing call options. In this paper, we extend this result to the cases involving unbounded initial functions. We prove that for $d$-dimensional linear Kolmogorov PDEs with unbounded initial functions, under suitable assumptions, the number of training data and the size of the artificial neural network required to achieve an accuracy $\varepsilon$ for the ERM grow polynomially in both $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$. Moreover, we verify that the required assumptions hold for Black-Scholes PDEs and heat equations which are two important cases of linear Kolmogorov PDEs. "

We generate multiple vectors in the latent space until we find a set of vectors that meets the desired distance requirements and the required batch size.To evaluate the effectiveness of our diversity methods, we conduct experiments examining various characteristics, including color diversity, LPIPS metric, and ethnicity/gender representation in images featuring humans.The results of our experiments emphasize the significance of diversity in generating realistic and varied images, offering valuable insights for improving text-to-image models. Through the enhancement of image diversity, our approach contributes to the creation of more inclusive and representative AI-generated art. "

However, language models have difficulty understanding the relationships between time specifiers, such as 'after' and 'before', and numbers, since existing QA datasets do not include sufficient time expressions. To address this issue, we propose a Time-Context aware Question Answering (TCQA) framework. We suggest a Time-Context dependent Span Extraction (TCSE) task, and build a time-context dependent data generation framework for model training. Moreover, we present a metric to evaluate the time awareness of the QA model using TCSE. The TCSE task consists of a question and four sentence candidates classified as correct or incorrect based on time and context. The model is trained to extract the answer span from the sentence that is both correct in time and context. The model trained with TCQA outperforms baseline models up to 8.5 of the F1-score in the TimeQA dataset. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/sonjbin/TCQA "

Drawing inspiration from Fawkes, our method entails shifting the original image within the embedding space towards a decoy image.We evaluate our approach using privacy metrics on traditional and novel facial image datasets. Additionally, we propose new criteria for evaluating the robustness of privacy-protection methods against unknown image recognition techniques, and we demonstrate that our approach is effective even in unknown embedding transfer scenarios. We also provide a human evaluation that further proves that the modified image preserves its utility as it remains recognisable as an image of the same person by friends and family. "

This work studies generalisation for datasets consisting of related tasks that may differ in causal mechanisms. For example, observational medical data for complex diseases suffers from heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of disease across patients, creating challenges for machine learning algorithms that need to generalise to new patients outside of the training dataset. Common approaches for learning supervised models with heterogeneous datasets include learning a global model for the entire dataset, learning local models for each tasks' data, or utilising hierarchical, meta-learning and multi-task learning approaches to learn how to generalise from data pooled across multiple tasks. In this paper we propose causal similarity-based hierarchical Bayesian models to improve generalisation to new tasks by learning how to pool data from training tasks with similar causal mechanisms. We apply this general modelling principle to Bayesian neural networks and compare a variety of methods for estimating causal task similarity (for both known and unknown causal models). We demonstrate the benefits of our approach and applicability to real world problems through a range of experiments on simulated and real data. "

An Empirical Study on Configuration Issues in Python PyPI  Ecosystem,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12598,"Yun Peng, Ruida Hu, Ruoke Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Shuqing Li, Michael R. Lyu",New submissions,Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Python is widely used in the open-source community, largely owing to the extensive support from diverse third-party libraries within the PyPI ecosystem. Nevertheless, the utilization of third-party libraries can potentially lead to conflicts in dependencies, prompting researchers to develop dependency conflict detectors. Moreover, endeavors have been made to automatically infer dependencies. These approaches focus on version-level checks and inference, based on the assumption that configurations of libraries in the PyPI ecosystem are correct. However, our study reveals that this assumption is not universally valid, and relying solely on version-level checks proves inadequate in ensuring compatible run-time environments. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively study the configuration issues in the PyPI ecosystem. Specifically, we propose PyCon, a source-level detector, for detecting potential configuration issues. PyCon employs three distinct checks, targeting the setup, packing, and usage stages of libraries, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the current automatic dependency inference approaches, we build a benchmark called VLibs, comprising library releases that pass all three checks of PyCon. We identify 15 kinds of configuration issues and find that 183,864 library releases suffer from potential configuration issues. Remarkably, 68% of these issues can only be detected via the source-level check. Our experiment results show that the most advanced automatic dependency inference approach, PyEGo, can successfully infer dependencies for only 65% of library releases. The primary failures stem from dependency conflicts and the absence of required libraries in the generated configurations. Based on the empirical results, we derive six findings and draw two implications for open-source developers and future research in automatic dependency inference. "

More than 140M fetuses are born yearly, resulting in numerous scans. The availability of a large volume of fetal ultrasound scans presents the opportunity to train robust machine learning models. However, the abundance of scans also has its challenges, as manual labeling of each image is needed for supervised methods. Labeling is typically labor-intensive and requires expertise to annotate the images accurately. This study presents an unsupervised approach for automatically clustering ultrasound images into a large range of fetal views, reducing or eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our Fetal Ultrasound Semantic Clustering (FUSC) method is developed using a large dataset of 88,063 images and further evaluated on an additional unseen dataset of 8,187 images achieving over 92% clustering purity. The result of our investigation hold the potential to significantly impact the field of fetal ultrasound imaging and pave the way for more advanced automated labeling solutions. Finally, we make the code and the experimental setup publicly available to help advance the field. "

Both additive and multiplicative corrections have been discussed. In this paper, we address some implementation drawbacks of the proposed additive correction scheme. In the existing approach, each coarse solution is applied only once, leaving most of the iterations of the solver without coarse-space information while building the right-hand side of the coarse problem. Moreover, one-sided routines of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard were considered, which introduced the need for a sleep statement in the iterations loop of the coarse solver. This implies a tuning of the sleep period, which is a non-discrete quantity. In this paper, we improve the accuracy of the coarse right-hand side, which allowed for more frequent corrections. In addition, we highlight a two-sided implementation which better suits the asynchronous coarse-space correction scheme. Numerical experiments show a significant performance gain with such increased incorporation of the coarse space. "

While some of these methods effectively address complex problems, they often depend heavily on inference-time obstacle detection and require additional equipment. Addressing these challenges, we present a method that, during inference time, simultaneously generates only reachable goals and plans motions that avoid obstacles, all from a single visual input. Central to our approach is the novel use of a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel for training. Through evaluations against behavior-cloning and classical diffusion models, our framework has proven its robustness. It is particularly effective in multi-modal environments, navigating toward goals and avoiding unreachable ones blocked by obstacles, while ensuring collision avoidance. "

However, we lack tools for effectively and efficiently changing this behavior without hurting general language modeling performance. In this paper, we study three methods for identifying causal relations between LM components and particular output: causal mediation analysis, automated circuit discovery and our novel, efficient method called DiffMask+ based on differential masking. We apply the methods to GPT-2 small and the problem of gender bias, and use the discovered sets of components to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning for bias mitigation. Our results show significant overlap in the identified components (despite huge differences in the computational requirements of the methods) as well as success in mitigating gender bias, with less damage to general language modeling compared to full model fine-tuning. However, our work also underscores the difficulty of defining and measuring bias, and the sensitivity of causal discovery procedures to dataset choice. We hope our work can contribute to more attention for dataset development, and lead to more effective mitigation strategies for other types of bias. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 178,How a student becomes a teacher: learning and forgetting through  Spectral methods,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12612,"Lorenzo Giambagli, Lorenzo Buffoni, Lorenzo Chicchi, Duccio Fanelli",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"In theoretical ML, the teacher-student paradigm is often employed as an effective metaphor for real-life tuition. The above scheme proves particularly relevant when the student network is overparameterized as compared to the teacher network. Under these operating conditions, it is tempting to speculate that the student ability to handle the given task could be eventually stored in a sub-portion of the whole network. This latter should be to some extent reminiscent of the frozen teacher structure, according to suitable metrics, while being approximately invariant across different architectures of the student candidate network. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art conventional learning techniques could not help in identifying the existence of such an invariant subnetwork, due to the inherent degree of non-convexity that characterizes the examined problem. In this work, we take a leap forward by proposing a radically different optimization scheme which builds on a spectral representation of the linear transfer of information between layers. The gradient is hence calculated with respect to both eigenvalues and eigenvectors with negligible increase in terms of computational and complexity load, as compared to standard training algorithms. Working in this framework, we could isolate a stable student substructure, that mirrors the true complexity of the teacher in terms of computing neurons, path distribution and topological attributes. When pruning unimportant nodes of the trained student, as follows a ranking that reflects the optimized eigenvalues, no degradation in the recorded performance is seen above a threshold that corresponds to the effective teacher size. The observed behavior can be pictured as a genuine second-order phase transition that bears universality traits. "

Some years later, Chang, Manna, and Pnueli built on this result to derive a similar normal form for LTL. Both normalization procedures have a non-elementary worst-case blow-up, and follow an involved path from formulas to counter-free automata to star-free regular expressions and back to formulas. We improve on both points. We present direct and purely syntactic normalization procedures for LTL, yielding a normal form very similar to the one by Chang, Manna, and Pnueli, that exhibit only a single exponential blow-up. As an application, we derive a simple algorithm to translate LTL into deterministic Rabin automata. The algorithm normalizes the formula, translates it into a special very weak alternating automaton, and applies a simple determinization procedure, valid only for these special automata. "

Among byzantine agreement tasks, firing rebels with relay is of particular interest, since it is a basic primitive necessary for solving more complex tasks such as Consistent Broadcast. The epistemic logic approach has yielded both necessary conditions and sufficient knowledge conditions for solving firing rebels with relay. However, these conditions are stated in terms of knowledge and in principle do not explore the conditions on the communication structure which is often assumed to be complete. That is, any process is assumed to be capable of communicating with any other process at any time. In this paper, we characterize byzantine firing rebels solvability with and without relay in terms of the communication structure of the system. We define a relation between asynchronous message schedules and directed graph sequences, which we call network abstractions. This allows us to capture the message relay capabilities of the system into a combinatorial object. Although there are some similarities between network abstractions and causal cones, there is a fundamental difference. Namely, causal cones allow only to look at events in the past, while network abstractions allow us to reason about future possibilities. Thus enabling us to reason about liveness properties, which can not be expressed by looking only at past events. Furthermore, we formalize our characterization by using a temporal epistemic logic for byzantine systems. Such formulation constitutes the necessary and sufficient a-priori knowledge regarding network connectivity for solving firing rebels with relay. "

To extract information from maps, neural networks, which gain wide popularity in recent years, have replaced hand-crafted map processing methods and tedious manual labor. However, aleatoric uncertainty, known as data-dependent uncertainty, inherent in the drawing/scanning/fading defects of the original map sheets and inadequate contexts when cropping maps into small tiles considering the memory limits of the training process, challenges the model to make correct predictions. As aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced even with more training data collected, we argue that complementary spatio-temporal contexts can be helpful. To achieve this, we propose a U-Net-based network that fuses spatio-temporal features with cross-attention transformers (U-SpaTem), aggregating information at a larger spatial range as well as through a temporal sequence of images. Our model achieves a better performance than other state-or-art models that use either temporal or spatial contexts. Compared with pure vision transformers, our model is more lightweight and effective. To the best of our knowledge, leveraging both spatial and temporal contexts have been rarely explored before in the segmentation task. Even though our application is on segmenting historical maps, we believe that the method can be transferred into other fields with similar problems like temporal sequences of satellite images. Our code is freely accessible at https://github.com/chenyizi086/wu.2023.sigspatial.git. "

How can a financial sentiment analysis system be trained in a volatile market environment that can accurately infer sentiment and be robust to temporal data distribution shifts?

We find that the fine-tuned models suffer from general performance degradation in the presence of temporal distribution shifts. Furthermore, motivated by the unique temporal nature of the financial text, we propose a novel method that combines out-of-distribution detection with time series modeling for temporal financial sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the model's capability to adapt to evolving temporal shifts in a volatile financial market. "

Unfortunately, most existing privacy-enhancing approaches are not applicable for protecting users' privacy in requests, which cannot be easily altered or distorted by users and must be visible for content providers to stream correct videos. To preserve request privacy in online video services, it is possible to request additional videos irrelevant to users' interests so that content providers cannot precisely infer users' interest information. However, a naive redundant requesting approach will significantly degrade the performance of edge caches and increase bandwidth overhead accordingly. In this paper, we are among the first to propose a Cache-Friendly Redundant Video Requesting (cRVR) algorithm for User Devices (UDs) and its corresponding caching algorithm for the Edge Cache (EC), which can effectively mitigate the problem of request privacy leakage with minimal impact on the EC's performance. To solve the problem, we develop a Stackelberg game to analyze the dedicated interaction between UDs and EC and obtain their optimal strategies to maximize their respective utility. For UDs, the utility function is a combination of both video playback utility and privacy protection utility. We theoretically prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game. In the end, extensive experiments are conducted with real traces to demonstrate that cRVR can effectively protect video request privacy by reducing up to 57.96\% of privacy disclosure compared to baseline algorithms. Meanwhile, the caching performance of ECs is only slightly affected. "

In non-laboratory environments with frequently changing process parameters, accurate determination of weld quality by destructive testing is economically unfeasible. Deep learning offers the potential to identify the relationships in available process data and predict the weld quality from process observations. In this paper, we present a concept for a deep learning based predictive quality system in \ac{GMAW}. At its core, the concept involves a pipeline consisting of four major phases: collection and management of multi-sensor data (e.g. current and voltage), real-time processing and feature engineering of the time series data by means of autoencoders, training and deployment of suitable recurrent deep learning models for quality predictions, and model evolutions under changing process conditions using continual learning.

Such an autoregressive manner only leverages unilateral dependencies during decoding and cannot fully explore the semantic dependency between sentences for ordering. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Ordering Network, dubbed \textit{NAON}, which explores bilateral dependencies between sentences and predicts the sentence for each position in parallel. We claim that the non-autoregressive manner is not just applicable but also particularly suitable to the sentence ordering task because of two peculiar characteristics of the task: 1) each generation target is in deterministic length, and 2) the sentences and positions should match exclusively. Furthermore, to address the repetition issue of the naive non-autoregressive Transformer, we introduce an exclusive loss to constrain the exclusiveness between positions and sentences. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on several common-used datasets and the experimental results show that our method outperforms all the autoregressive approaches and yields competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts.

A set of functions of the form $x\to ax \bmod p$, where $a$ is taken from ${\mathbb Z}_p$, has attracted some attention from deep learning theorists and cryptographers recently. This class can be understood as a subset of $p$-periodic functions on ${\mathbb Z}$ and is tightly connected with a class of high-frequency periodic functions on the real line. We present a mathematical analysis of limitations and challenges associated with using gradient-based learning techniques to train a high-frequency periodic function or modular multiplication from examples. We highlight that the variance of the gradient is negligibly small in both cases when either a frequency or the prime base $p$ is large. This in turn prevents such a learning algorithm from being successful. "

Preece, Federico Cerutti, Lance M. Kaplan, Supriyo Chakraborty",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG),"This work reveals an evidential signal that emerges from the uncertainty value in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). EDL is one example of a class of uncertainty-aware deep learning approaches designed to provide confidence (or epistemic uncertainty) about the current test sample. In particular for computer vision and bidirectional encoder large language models, the `evidential signal' arising from the Dirichlet strength in EDL can, in some cases, discriminate between classes, which is particularly strong when using large language models. We hypothesise that the KL regularisation term causes EDL to couple aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we empirically investigate the correlations between misclassification and evaluated uncertainty, and show that EDL's `evidential signal' is due to misclassification bias. We critically evaluate EDL with other Dirichlet-based approaches, namely Generative Evidential Neural Networks (EDL-GEN) and Prior Networks, and show theoretically and empirically the differences between these loss functions. We conclude that EDL's coupling of uncertainty arises from these differences due to the use (or lack) of out-of-distribution samples during training. "

Evaluating Language Models on Financial  Natural Language Processing,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12664,"Yue Guo, Zian Xu, Yi Yang",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has revolutionized general natural language preprocessing (NLP) tasks. However, their expertise in the financial domain lacks a comprehensive evaluation. To assess the ability of LLMs to solve financial NLP tasks, we present FinLMEval, a framework for Financial Language Model Evaluation, comprising nine datasets designed to evaluate the performance of language models. This study compares the performance of encoder-only language models and the decoder-only language models. Our findings reveal that while some decoder-only LLMs demonstrate notable performance across most financial tasks via zero-shot prompting, they generally lag behind the fine-tuned expert models, especially when dealing with proprietary datasets. We hope this study provides foundation evaluations for continuing efforts to build more advanced LLMs in the financial domain. "

Various empirical research has been done in this field. However, most of the experiments are performed on target ML models trained by the security researchers themselves. Due to the high computational resource requirement for training advanced models with complex architectures, researchers generally choose to train a few target models using relatively simple architectures on typical experiment datasets. We argue that to understand ML models' vulnerabilities comprehensively, experiments should be performed on a large set of models trained with various purposes (not just the purpose of evaluating ML attacks and defenses). To this end, we propose using publicly available models with weights from the Internet (public models) for evaluating attacks and defenses on ML models. We establish a database, namely SecurityNet, containing 910 annotated image classification models. We then analyze the effectiveness of several representative attacks/defenses, including model stealing attacks, membership inference attacks, and backdoor detection on these public models. Our evaluation empirically shows the performance of these attacks/defenses can vary significantly on public models compared to self-trained models. We share SecurityNet with the research community. and advocate researchers to perform experiments on public models to better demonstrate their proposed methods' effectiveness in the future. "

A Trading Networks Based  Analysis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12666,"Segev Wasserkrug, Takayuki Osogami",New submissions,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"In enterprise cloud computing, there is a big and increasing investment to move to multi-cloud computing, which allows enterprises to seamlessly utilize IT resources from multiple cloud providers, so as to take advantage of different cloud providers' capabilities and costs. This investment raises several key questions: Will multi-cloud always be more beneficial to the cloud users? How will this impact the cloud providers? Is it possible to create a multi-cloud market that is beneficial to all participants? In this work, we begin addressing these questions by using the game theoretic model of trading networks and formally compare between the single and multi-cloud markets. This comparson a) provides a sufficient condition under which the multi-cloud network can be considered more efficient than the single cloud one in the sense that a centralized coordinator having full information can impose an outcome that is strongly Pareto-dominant for all players and b) shows a surprising result that without centralized coordination, settings are possible in which even the cloud buyers' utilities may decrease when moving from a single cloud to a multi-cloud network. As these two results emphasize the need for centralized coordination to ensure a Pareto-dominant outcome and as the aforementioned Pareto-dominant result requires truthful revelation of participant's private information, we provide an automated mechanism design (AMD) approach, which, in the Bayesian setting, finds mechanisms which result in expectation in such Pareto-dominant outcomes, and in which truthful revelation of the parties' private information is the dominant strategy. We also provide empirical analysis to show the validity of our AMD approach. "

Thus, efficient and reliable fault-tolerance methods are in urgent need. Checkpointing is the primary fault-tolerance method to periodically save parameter snapshots from GPU memory to disks via CPU memory. In this paper, we identify the frequency of existing checkpoint-based fault-tolerance being significantly limited by the storage I/O overheads, which results in hefty re-training costs on restarting from the nearest checkpoint. In response to this gap, we introduce an in-memory fault-tolerance framework for large-scale LLM pretraining. The framework boosts the efficiency and reliability of fault tolerance from three aspects: (1) Reduced Data Transfer and I/O: By asynchronously caching parameters, i.e., sharded model parameters, optimizer states, and RNG states, to CPU volatile memory, Our framework significantly reduces communication costs and bypasses checkpoint I/O. (2) Enhanced System Reliability: Our framework enhances parameter protection with a two-layer hierarchy: snapshot management processes (SMPs) safeguard against software failures, together with Erasure Coding (EC) protecting against node failures. This double-layered protection greatly improves the survival probability of the parameters compared to existing checkpointing methods. (3) Improved Snapshotting Frequency: Our framework achieves more frequent snapshotting compared with asynchronous checkpointing optimizations under the same saving time budget, which improves the fault tolerance efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Our framework minimizes the overhead of fault tolerance of LLM pretraining by effectively leveraging redundant CPU resources. "

Due to their success in other fields, machine learning techniques are gaining popularity within the actuarial toolbox. Our paper contributes to the literature on frequency-severity insurance pricing with machine learning via deep learning structures. We present a benchmark study on four insurance data sets with frequency and severity targets in the presence of multiple types of input features. We compare in detail the performance of: a generalized linear model on binned input data, a gradient-boosted tree model, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and the combined actuarial neural network (CANN). Our CANNs combine a baseline prediction established with a GLM and GBM, respectively, with a neural network correction. We explain the data preprocessing steps with specific focus on the multiple types of input features typically present in tabular insurance data sets, such as postal codes, numeric and categorical covariates. Autoencoders are used to embed the categorical variables into the neural network and we explore their potential advantages in a frequency-severity setting. Finally, we construct global surrogate models for the neural nets' frequency and severity models. These surrogates enable the translation of the essential insights captured by the FFNNs or CANNs to GLMs. As such, a technical tariff table results that can easily be deployed in practice. "

Broad uptake of those methods in hospitals is currently hindered because the methods have too many constraints. They assume annotations available for single images or even regions-of-interest (ROIs), and a fixed number of images per patient. Both assumptions do not hold in a general hospital setting. Relaxing those assumptions results in a weakly supervised learning setting, where labels are available per case, but not for individual images or ROIs. Not all images taken for a patient contain malignant regions and the malignant ROIs cover only a tiny part of an image, whereas most image regions represent benign tissue. In this work, we investigate a two-level multi-instance learning (MIL) approach for case-level breast cancer prediction on two public datasets (1.6k and 5k cases) and an in-house dataset of 21k cases. Observing that breast cancer is usually only present in one side, while images of both breasts are taken as a precaution, we propose a domain-specific MIL pooling variant. We show that two-level MIL can be applied in realistic clinical settings where only case labels, and a variable number of images per patient are available. Data in realistic settings scales with continuous patient intake, while manual annotation efforts do not. Hence, research should focus in particular on unsupervised ROI extraction, in order to improve breast cancer prediction for all patients. "

In this work, we present TapMo, a Text-driven Animation Pipeline for synthesizing Motion in a broad spectrum of skeleton-free 3D characters. The pivotal innovation in TapMo is its use of shape deformation-aware features as a condition to guide the diffusion model, thereby enabling the generation of mesh-specific motions for various characters. Specifically, TapMo comprises two main components - Mesh Handle Predictor and Shape-aware Diffusion Module. Mesh Handle Predictor predicts the skinning weights and clusters mesh vertices into adaptive handles for deformation control, which eliminates the need for traditional skeletal rigging. Shape-aware Motion Diffusion synthesizes motion with mesh-specific adaptations. This module employs text-guided motions and mesh features extracted during the first stage, preserving the geometric integrity of the animations by accounting for the character's shape and deformation. Trained in a weakly-supervised manner, TapMo can accommodate a multitude of non-human meshes, both with and without associated text motions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TapMo through rigorous qualitative and quantitative experiments. Our results reveal that TapMo consistently outperforms existing auto-animation methods, delivering superior-quality animations for both seen or unseen heterogeneous 3D characters. "

Besides, existing analyses primarily focus on single-head attention. Inspired by the demonstrated benefits of overparameterization when training fully-connected networks, we investigate the potential optimization and generalization advantages of using multiple attention heads. Towards this goal, we derive convergence and generalization guarantees for gradient-descent training of a single-layer multi-head self-attention model, under a suitable realizability condition on the data. We then establish primitive conditions on the initialization that ensure realizability holds. Finally, we demonstrate that these conditions are satisfied for a simple tokenized-mixture model. We expect the analysis can be extended to various data-model and architecture variations. "

There are also cyber assaults. Cyberattacks pose a possible danger to information security and the general public. Since data practice and internet consumption rates continue to upswing, cyber awareness has become progressively important. Furthermore, as businesses pace their digital transformation with mobile devices, cloud services, communal media, and Internet of Things services, cybersecurity has appeared as a critical issue in corporate risk management. This research focuses on the relations between cybersecurity awareness, cyber knowledge, computer ethics, cyber ethics, and cyber behavior, as well as protective tools, across university students in general. The findings express that while internet users are alert of cyber threats, they only take the most elementary and easy-to-implement precautions. Several knowledge and awareness have been proposed to knob the issue of cyber security. It also grants the principles of cybersecurity in terms of its structure, workforces, and evidence pertaining to the shield of personal information in the cyber world. The first step is for people to educate themselves about the negative aspects of the internet and to learn more about cyber threats so that they can notice when an attack is taking place. To validate the efficiency of the suggested analysis between CS and non-CS university students, case study along with several comparisons are provided. "

Factorizing the model's matrices using low-rank approximations is a promising method for achieving compression. While it is possible to set the rank before training, this approach is neither flexible nor optimal. In this work, we propose a post-training rank-selection method called Rank-Tuning that selects a different rank for each matrix. Used in combination with training adaptations, our method achieves high compression rates with no or little performance degradation. Our numerical experiments on signal processing tasks show that we can compress recurrent neural networks up to 14x with at most 1.4% relative performance reduction. "

The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic grounding. Specifically, the framework introduces two new tools: (i) neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an entity's symbolic attributes using vision-language foundation models. Through an evaluation that considers two different forms of CG on an established blocks-pushing domain, we show that the framework establishes a new state-of-the-art for CG in world modeling. "

In this paper, we consider the computational problem of finding the minimizer of the Sobolev $\mathrm{W}^{1,p}$ semi-norm with a data-fidelity term. We propose a discretization procedure and prove convergence rates between our numerical solution and the target function. Our approach consists of discretizing an appropriate gradient flow problem in space and time. The space discretization is a nonlocal approximation of the p-Laplacian operator and our rates directly depend on the localization parameter $\epsilon_n$ and the time mesh-size $\tau_n$. We precisely characterize the asymptotic behaviour of $\epsilon_n$ and $\tau_n$ in order to ensure convergence to the considered minimizer. Finally, we apply our results to the setting of random graph models. "

CARP learns prototypes in an end-to-end online fashion using gradient descent without additional non-differentiable modules to solve the cluster assignment problem. CARP optimizes a new pretext task based on random partitions of prototypes that regularizes the model and enforces consistency between views' assignments. Additionally, our method improves training stability and prevents collapsed solutions in joint-embedding training. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that CARP's representations are suitable for learning downstream tasks. We evaluate CARP's representations capabilities in 17 datasets across many standard protocols, including linear evaluation, few-shot classification, k-NN, k-means, image retrieval, and copy detection. We compare CARP performance to 11 existing self-supervised methods. We extensively ablate our method and demonstrate that our proposed random partition pretext task improves the quality of the learned representations by devising multiple random classification tasks. In transfer learning tasks, CARP achieves the best performance on average against many SSL methods trained for a longer time. "

In this work, we present RandGener, a novel $n$-party commit-reveal-recover (or collaborative) DRB protocol with a novel reward and penalty mechanism along with a set of realistic guarantees. We design our protocol using trapdoor watermarkable verifiable delay functions in the RSA group setting (without requiring a trusted dealer or distributed key generation). "

Such answers can be found efficiently for conjunctive queries and their unions, even in the presence of constraints. With negation added, the problem becomes intractable however. We concentrate on the complexity of certain answers under constraints, and on effficiently answering queries outside the usual classes of (unions) of conjunctive queries by means of rewriting as Datalog and first-order queries. We first notice that there are three different ways in which query answering can be cast as a decision problem. We complete the existing picture and provide precise complexity bounds on all versions of the decision problem, for certain and best answers. We then study a well-behaved class of queries that extends unions of conjunctive queries with a mild form of negation. We show that for them, certain answers can be expressed in Datalog with negation, even in the presence of functional dependencies, thus making them tractable in data complexity. We show that in general Datalog cannot be replaced by first-order logic, but without constraints such a rewriting can be done in first-order. The paper is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). "

Administrators can mitigate such disruptions by enforcing ""page protection"" that selectively limits contributions to specific articles to help prevent the degradation of content. However, this practice contradicts one of Wikipedia's fundamental principles$-$that it is open to all contributors$-$and may hinder further improvement of the encyclopedia. In this paper, we examine the effect of page protection on article quality to better understand whether and when page protections are warranted. Using decade-long data on page protections from the English Wikipedia, we conduct a quasi-experimental study analyzing pages that received ""requests for page protection""$-$written appeals submitted by Wikipedia editors to administrators to impose page protections. We match pages that indeed received page protection with similar pages that did not and quantify the causal effect of the interventions on a well-established measure of article quality. Our findings indicate that the effect of page protection on article quality depends on the characteristics of the page prior to the intervention: high-quality articles are affected positively as opposed to low-quality articles that are impacted negatively. Subsequent analysis suggests that high-quality articles degrade when left unprotected, whereas low-quality articles improve. Overall, with our study, we outline page protections on Wikipedia and inform best practices on whether and when to protect an article. "

Simply put, time progresses one unit per step and the availability of edges can change with time. We consider the complexity of solving $\omega$-regular games played on temporal graphs where the edge availability is ultimately periodic and fixed a priori. We show that solving parity games on temporal graphs is decidable in PSPACE, only assuming the edge predicate itself is in PSPACE. A matching lower bound already holds for what we call punctual reachability games on static graphs, where one player wants to reach the target at a given, binary encoded, point in time. We further study syntactic restrictions that imply more efficient procedures. In particular, if the edge predicate is in $P$ and is monotonically increasing for one player and decreasing for the other, then the complexity of solving games is only polynomially increased compared to static graphs.

Current SFOD methods utilize a threshold-based pseudo-label approach in the adaptation phase, which is typically limited to high-confidence pseudo-labels and results in a loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to take full advantage of pseudo-labels by introducing high and low confidence thresholds. Specifically, the pseudo-labels with confidence scores above the high threshold are used conventionally, while those between the low and high thresholds are exploited using the Low-confidence Pseudo-labels Utilization (LPU) module. The LPU module consists of Proposal Soft Training (PST) and Local Spatial Contrastive Learning (LSCL). PST generates soft labels of proposals for soft training, which can mitigate the label mismatch problem. LSCL exploits the local spatial relationship of proposals to improve the model's ability to differentiate between spatially adjacent proposals, thereby optimizing representational features further. Combining the two components overcomes the challenges faced by traditional methods in utilizing low-confidence pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on five cross-domain object detection benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous SFOD methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. "

Harikrishnan, Debayan Gupta",New submissions,Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"The average user has between 90-130 online accounts, and around $3 \times 10^{11}$ passwords are in use this year. Most people are terrible at remembering ""random"" passwords, so they reuse or create similar passwords using a combination of predictable words, numbers, and symbols. Previous password-generation or management protocols have imposed so large a cognitive load that users have abandoned them in favor of insecure yet simpler methods (e.g., writing them down or reusing minor variants). We describe a range of candidate human-computable ""hash"" functions suitable for use as password generators - as long as the human (with minimal education assumptions) keeps a single, easily-memorizable ""master"" secret - and rate them by various metrics, including effective security. These functions hash master-secrets with user accounts to produce sub-secrets that can be used as passwords; $F_R($s$, w) \longrightarrow y$, takes a website $w$, produces a password $y$, parameterized by master secret $s$, which may or may not be a string. We exploit the unique configuration $R$ of each user's associative and implicit memory (detailed in section 2) to ensure that sources of randomness unique to each user are present in each master-secret $F_R$. An adversary cannot compute or verify $F_R$ efficiently since $R$ is unique to each individual; in that sense, our hash function is similar to a physically unclonable function. For the algorithms we propose, the user need only complete primitive operations such as addition, spatial navigation or searching. Critically, most of our methods are also accessible to neurodiverse, or cognitively or physically differently-abled persons. We present results from a survey (n=134 individuals) investigating real-world usage of these methods and how people currently come up with their passwords, we also survey 400 websites to collate current password advice.

In this study, we propose a novel privacypreserving image classification scheme that enables the direct application of classifiers trained in the plaintext domain to classify encrypted images, without the need of retraining a dedicated classifier. Moreover, encrypted images can be decrypted back into their original form with high fidelity (recoverable) using a secret key. Specifically, our proposed scheme involves utilizing a feature extractor and an encoder to mask the plaintext image through a newly designed Noise-like Adversarial Example (NAE). Such an NAE not only introduces a noise-like visual appearance to the encrypted image but also compels the target classifier to predict the ciphertext as the same label as the original plaintext image. At the decoding phase, we adopt a Symmetric Residual Learning (SRL) framework for restoring the plaintext image with minimal degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) the classification accuracy of the classifier trained in the plaintext domain remains the same in both the ciphertext and plaintext domains; 2) the encrypted images can be recovered into their original form with an average PSNR of up to 51+ dB for the SVHN dataset and 48+ dB for the VGGFace2 dataset; 3) our system exhibits satisfactory generalization capability on the encryption, decryption and classification tasks across datasets that are different from the training one; and 4) a high-level of security is achieved against three potential threat models.

Adversarial examples (AEs) deliberately designed to mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be fragile against the inevitable lossy operations conducted by OSNs. As a result, the AEs would lose their attack capabilities after being transmitted over OSNs. In this work, we aim to design a new framework for generating robust AEs that can survive the OSN transmission; namely, the AEs before and after the OSN transmission both possess strong attack capabilities. To this end, we first propose a differentiable network termed SImulated OSN (SIO) to simulate the various operations conducted by an OSN. Specifically, the SIO network consists of two modules: 1) a differentiable JPEG layer for approximating the ubiquitous JPEG compression and 2) an encoder-decoder subnetwork for mimicking the remaining operations. Based upon the SIO network, we then formulate an optimization framework to generate robust AEs by enforcing model outputs with and without passing through the SIO to be both misled. Extensive experiments conducted over Facebook, WeChat and QQ demonstrate that our attack methods produce more robust AEs than existing approaches, especially under small distortion constraints; the performance gain in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) could be more than 60%. Furthermore, we build a public dataset containing more than 10,000 pairs of AEs processed by Facebook, WeChat or QQ, facilitating future research in the robust AEs generation.

Entropy-loading digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) is the core technology to achieve low latency and approach high capacity for flexible PtMP optical networks. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio of the entropy-loading DSCM signal limits the power budget and restricts the capacity, which can be reduced effectively by clipping operation. In this paper, we derive the theoretical capacity limitation of the flexible PtMP optical networks based on the entropy-loading DSCM signal. Meanwhile, an optimal clipping ratio for the clipping operation is acquired to approach the highest capacity limitation. Based on an accurate clipping-noise model under the optimal clipping ratio, we establish a three-dimensional look-up table for bit-error ratio, spectral efficiency, and link loss. Based on the three-dimensional look-up table, an optimization strategy is proposed to acquire optimal spectral efficiencies for achieving a higher capacity of the flexible PtMP optical networks. "

Jennings",New submissions,Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optimization and Control (math.OC),"The simplex gradient, a popular numerical differentiation method due to its flexibility, lacks a principled method by which to construct the sample set, specifically the location of function evaluations. Such evaluations, especially from real-world systems, are often noisy and expensive to obtain, making it essential that each evaluation is carefully chosen to reduce cost and increase accuracy. This paper introduces the curvature aligned simplex gradient (CASG), which provably selects the optimal sample set under a mean squared error objective. As CASG requires function-dependent information often not available in practice, we additionally introduce a framework which exploits a history of function evaluations often present in practical applications. Our numerical results, focusing on applications in sensitivity analysis and derivative free optimization, show that our methodology significantly outperforms or matches the performance of the benchmark gradient estimator given by forward differences (FD) which is given exact function-dependent information that is not available in practice. Furthermore, our methodology is comparable to the performance of central differences (CD) that requires twice the number of function evaluations. "

However, existing methods essentially assist the current state of target model to defend against parameter-oriented adversarial attacks with explicit or implicit computation burdens, which also suffers from unstable convergence behavior due to inconsistency of optimization trajectories. Diverging from previous work, this paper reconsiders the update rule of target model and corresponding deficiency to defend based on its current state. By introducing the historical state of the target model as a proxy, which is endowed with much prior information for defense, we formulate a two-stage update rule, resulting in a general adversarial defense framework, which we refer to as `LAST' ({\bf L}earn from the P{\bf ast}). Besides, we devise a Self Distillation (SD) based defense objective to constrain the update process of the proxy model without the introduction of larger teacher models. Experimentally, we demonstrate consistent and significant performance enhancements by refining a series of single-step and multi-step AT methods (e.g., up to $\bf 9.2\%$ and $\bf 20.5\%$ improvement of Robust Accuracy (RA) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, respectively) across various datasets, backbones and attack modalities, and validate its ability to enhance training stability and ameliorate catastrophic overfitting issues meanwhile.

Buoyed by the excitement around secure decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies, the last decade has witnessed numerous constructions of TLP variants and related applications (e.g., cost-efficient blockchain designs, randomness beacons, e-voting, etc.). In this poster, we first extend the notion of TLP by formally defining the ""time-lock public key encryption"" (TLPKE) scheme.

Most of the existing mature video understanding techniques perform well with short formats and content that requires only shallow understanding, but do not perform well with long format videos that require deep understanding and reasoning. Deep Video Understanding (DVU) Challenge aims to push the boundaries of multimodal extraction, fusion, and analytics to address the problem of holistically analyzing long videos and extract useful knowledge to solve different types of queries. This paper introduces a query-aware method for long video localization and relation discrimination, leveraging an imagelanguage pretrained model. This model adeptly selects frames pertinent to queries, obviating the need for a complete movie-level knowledge graph. Our approach achieved first and fourth positions for two groups of movie-level queries. Sufficient experiments and final rankings demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. "

With the increasing success of recently proposed approaches to automating certain aspects of the traditional comparative method, the formal representation of proto-forms has also improved. This formalization makes it possible to address both the representation and the computation of uncertainty. Building on recent advances in supervised phonological reconstruction, during which an algorithm learns how to reconstruct words in a given proto-language relying on previously annotated data, and inspired by improved methods for automated word prediction from cognate sets, we present a new framework that allows for the representation of uncertainty in linguistic reconstruction and also includes a workflow for the computation of fuzzy reconstructions from linguistic data.

Despite its potential, the complex nature of radar signals and the inherent challenges associated with processing these signals have limited the widespread adoption of this technology. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing novel improvements to an existing method for radar odometry estimation, designed to enhance accuracy and reliability in diverse scenarios. Our pipeline consists of filtering, motion compensation, oriented surface points computation, smoothing, one-to-many radar scan registration, and pose refinement. The developed method enforces local understanding of the scene, by adding additional information through smoothing techniques, and alignment of consecutive scans, as a refinement posterior to the one-to-many registration. We present an in-depth investigation of the contribution of each improvement to the localization accuracy, and we benchmark our system on the sequences of the main datasets for radar understanding, i.e., the Oxford Radar RobotCar, MulRan, and Boreas datasets. The proposed pipeline is able to achieve superior results, on all scenarios considered and under harsh environmental constraints. "

We waited so long because, before making a claim of this type, we wanted to be sure of the consistency of the result. All this time the program has always been public; anyone could download it, modify it and independently obtain the reported results. In this period there have been many information theory experts who have tested the program and agreed to help us, we thank these people for the time dedicated to us and their precious advice. Given a sequence S of random variables i.i.d. with symbols belonging to an alphabet A; the parameter NH0(S) (the zero-order empirical entropy multiplied by the length of the sequence) is considered the average coding limit of the symbols of the sequence S through a uniquely decipherable and instantaneous code. Our experiment that calls into question this limit is the following: a sequence S is generated in a random and uniform way, the value NH0(S) is calculated, the sequence S is transformed into a new sequence f(S), longer but with the symbols belonging to the same alphabet, finally we code f(S) using Huffman coding. By generating a statistically significant number of sequences we obtain that the average value of the length of the encoded sequence f(S) is less than the average value of NH0(S). In this way, a result is obtained which is incompatible with the meaning given to NH0(S). "

By applying analytic continuation, the mixed boundaries are transformed to a homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problem, which is subsequently solved via an efficient and accurate iterative method with boundary conditions of static equilibrium, displacement single-valuedness, and traction along tunnel periphery. The Lanczos filtering technique is used in the final stress and displacement solution to reduce the Gibbs phenomena caused by the constrained far-field ground surface for more accurte results. Several numerical cases are conducted to intensively verify the proposed solution by examining boundary conditions and comparing with existing solutions, and all the results are in good agreements. Then more numerical cases are conducted to investigate the stress and deformation distribution along ground surface and tunnel periphery, and several engineering advices are given. Further discussions on the defects of the proposed solution are also conducted for objectivity. "

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 232,TabuLa: Harnessing Language Models for Tabular Data Synthesis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12746,"Zilong Zhao, Robert Birke, Lydia Chen",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Given the ubiquitous use of tabular data in industries and the growing concerns in data privacy and security, tabular data synthesis emerges as a critical research area. The recent state-of-the-art methods show that large language models (LLMs) can be adopted to generate realistic tabular data. As LLMs pre-process tabular data as full text, they have the advantage of avoiding the curse of dimensionality associated with one-hot encoding high-dimensional data. However, their long training time and limited re-usability on new tasks prevent them from replacing exiting tabular generative models. In this paper, we propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer based on the language model structure. Through Tabula, we demonstrate the inherent limitation of employing pre-trained language models designed for natural language processing (NLP) in the context of tabular data synthesis. Our investigation delves into the development of a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically for tabular data synthesis. Additionally, we propose a token sequence compression strategy to significantly reduce training time while preserving the quality of synthetic data. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that using a language model structure without loading the well-trained model weights yields a better starting model for tabular data synthesis. Moreover, the Tabula model, previously trained on other tabular data, serves as an excellent foundation model for new tabular data synthesis tasks. Additionally, the token sequence compression method substantially reduces the model's training time. Results show that Tabula averagely reduces 46.2% training time per epoch comparing to current LLMs-based state-of-the-art algorithm and consistently achieves even higher synthetic data utility. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 233,Character-level Chinese Backpack Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12751,"Hao Sun, John Hewitt",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"The Backpack is a Transformer alternative shown to improve interpretability in English language modeling by decomposing predictions into a weighted sum of token sense components. However, Backpacks' reliance on token-defined meaning raises questions as to their potential for languages other than English, a language for which subword tokenization provides a reasonable approximation for lexical items. In this work, we train, evaluate, interpret, and control Backpack language models in character-tokenized Chinese, in which words are often composed of many characters. We find that our (134M parameter) Chinese Backpack language model performs comparably to a (104M parameter) Transformer, and learns rich character-level meanings that log-additively compose to form word meanings. In SimLex-style lexical semantic evaluations, simple averages of Backpack character senses outperform input embeddings from a Transformer. We find that complex multi-character meanings are often formed by using the same per-character sense weights consistently across context. Exploring interpretability-through control, we show that we can localize a source of gender bias in our Backpacks to specific character senses and intervene to reduce the bias. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 234,Discretize Relaxed Solution of Spectral Clustering via a Non-Heuristic  Algorithm,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12752,"Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Spectral clustering and its extensions usually consist of two steps: (1) constructing a graph and computing the relaxed solution; (2) discretizing relaxed solutions. Although the former has been extensively investigated, the discretization techniques are mainly heuristic methods, e.g., k-means, spectral rotation. Unfortunately, the goal of the existing methods is not to find a discrete solution that minimizes the original objective. In other words, the primary drawback is the neglect of the original objective when computing the discrete solution. Inspired by the first-order optimization algorithms, we propose to develop a first-order term to bridge the original problem and discretization algorithm, which is the first non-heuristic to the best of our knowledge. Since the non-heuristic method is aware of the original graph cut problem, the final discrete solution is more reliable and achieves the preferable loss value. We also theoretically show that the continuous optimum is beneficial to discretization algorithms though simply finding its closest discrete solution is an existing heuristic algorithm which is also unreliable. Sufficient experiments significantly show the superiority of our method. "

Bissyande",New submissions,Software Engineering (cs.SE),"In recent years, patch representation learning has emerged as a necessary research direction for exploiting the capabilities of machine learning in software generation. These representations have driven significant performance enhancements across a variety of tasks involving code changes. While the progress is undeniable, a common limitation among existing models is their specialization: they predominantly excel in either predictive tasks, such as security patch classification, or in generative tasks such as patch description generation. This dichotomy is further exacerbated by a prevalent dependency on potentially noisy data sources. Specifically, many models utilize patches integrated with Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) that, unfortunately, may contain parsing inaccuracies, thus acting as a suboptimal source of supervision. In response to these challenges, we introduce PATCH-CLIP, a novel pre-training framework for patches and natural language text. PATCH-CLIP deploys a triple-loss training strategy for 1) patch-description contrastive learning, which enables to separate patches and descriptions in the embedding space, 2) patch-description matching, which ensures that each patch is associated to its description in the embedding space, and 3) patch-description generation, which ensures that the patch embedding is effective for generation. These losses are implemented for joint learning to achieve good performance in both predictive and generative tasks involving patches. Empirical evaluations focusing on patch description generation, demonstrate that PATCH-CLIP sets new state of the art performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art in metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and Recall.

Current state-of-the-art systems incorporate numerous inductive biases and employ cumbersome decoders. Building upon the original motivations of plain ViTs, which are simplicity and generality, we explore high-performance `minimalist' systems to this end. Our primary purpose is to provide simple and efficient baselines for practical semantic segmentation with plain ViTs. Specifically, we first explore the feasibility and methodology for achieving high-performance semantic segmentation using the last feature map. As a result, we introduce the PlainSeg, a model comprising only three 3$\times$3 convolutions in addition to the transformer layers (either encoder or decoder). In this process, we offer insights into two underlying principles: (i) high-resolution features are crucial to high performance in spite of employing simple up-sampling techniques and (ii) the slim transformer decoder requires a much larger learning rate than the wide transformer decoder. On this basis, we further present the PlainSeg-Hier, which allows for the utilization of hierarchical features. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our methods. They can also serve as powerful tools for assessing the transfer ability of base models in semantic segmentation. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ydhongHIT/PlainSeg}. "

We investigate this logic in terms of domain theory, (point-free) topology and geometric logic. This yields the first steps toward an extension of the ""Domain Theory in Logical Form"" paradigm to temporal liveness properties. We show that the negation-free formulae of LTL induce sober subspaces of streams, but that this is in general not the case in presence of negation. We propose a direct, inductive, translation of negation-free LTL to geometric logic. This translation reflects the approximations used to compute the usual fixpoint representations of LTL modalities. As a motivating example, we handle a natural input-output specification for the usual filter function on streams. "

Unlike AR models, these models do not have autoregressive dependencies among outputs which makes inference efficient. This paper expands the range of available non-AR models with another member called energy-based models (EBMs). The paper describes how noise contrastive estimation, which relies on the comparison between positive and negative samples, can be used to train EBMs. It proposes a number of strategies for generating effective negative samples, including using high-performing AR models. It also describes how sampling from EBMs can be performed using Langevin Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). The use of Langevin MCMC enables to draw connections between EBMs and currently popular diffusion models.

The ground truth labels for classification per jurisdiction are taken from the Entity Legal Form (ELF) code standard (ISO 20275). Our findings demonstrate that pre-trained BERT variants outperform traditional text classification approaches in terms of F1 score, while also performing comparably well in the Macro F1 Score. Moreover, the validity of our proposal is supported by the outcome of third-party expert reviews conducted in ten selected jurisdictions. This study highlights the significant potential of Transformer-based models in advancing data standardization and data integration. The presented approaches can greatly benefit financial institutions, corporations, governments and other organizations in assessing business relationships, understanding risk exposure, and promoting effective governance.

Thejaswini, Irmak Sağlam, Satya Prakash Nayak",New submissions,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"This paper considers the problem of solving infinite two-player games over finite graphs under various classes of progress assumptions motivated by applications in cyber-physical system (CPS) design. Formally, we consider a game graph G, a temporal specification $\Phi$ and a temporal assumption $\psi$, where both are given as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas over the vertex set of G. We call the tuple $(G,\Phi,\psi)$ an 'augmented game' and interpret it in the classical way, i.e., winning the augmented game $(G,\Phi,\psi)$ is equivalent to winning the (standard) game $(G,\psi \implies \Phi)$. Given a reachability or parity game $(G,\Phi)$ and some progress assumption $\psi$, this paper establishes whether solving the augmented game $(G,\Phi,\psi)$ lies in the same complexity class as solving $(G,\Phi)$. While the answer to this question is negative for arbitrary combinations of $\Phi$ and $\psi$, a positive answer results in more efficient algorithms, in particular for large game graphs. We therefore restrict our attention to particular classes of CPS-motivated progress assumptions and establish the worst-case time complexity of the resulting augmented games. Thereby, we pave the way towards a better understanding of assumption classes that can enable the development of efficient solution algorithms in augmented two-player games. "

Applying multiple instance learning-based methods or transformer models is computationally expensive as, for each image, all instances have to be processed simultaneously. The MLP-Mixer is an under-explored alternative model to common vision transformers, especially for large-scale datasets. Due to the lack of a self-attention mechanism, they have linear computational complexity to the number of input patches but achieve comparable performance on natural image datasets. We propose a combination of feature embedding and clustering to preprocess the full whole-slide image into a reduced prototype representation which can then serve as input to a suitable MLP-Mixer architecture. Our experiments on two public benchmarks and one inhouse malignant lymphoma dataset show comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods, while achieving lower training costs in terms of computational time and memory load.

On the one hand, we have deterministic or full gradient (FG) approaches that have a cost proportional to the amount of training data used but have a linear convergence rate, and on the other hand, stochastic gradient (SG) methods that have a cost independent of the size of the dataset, but have a less optimal convergence rate than the determinist approaches. To combine the cost of the stochastic approach with the convergence rate of the deterministic approach, a stochastic average gradient (SAG) has been proposed. SAG is a method for optimizing the sum of a finite number of smooth convex functions. Like SG methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. In this work, we propose to compare SAG to some standard optimizers used in machine learning. SAG converges faster than other optimizers on simple toy problems and performs better than many other optimizers on simple machine learning problems. We also propose a combination of SAG with the momentum algorithm and Adam. These combinations allow empirically higher speed and obtain better performance than the other methods, especially when the landscape of the function to optimize presents obstacles or is ill-conditioned.

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations. "

Black-box prompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive properties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern black-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the crucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting LLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate amount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search methods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of complex approaches while significantly reducing search costs. Our findings underscore the critical role of search space design and optimization in enhancing both the usefulness and the efficiency of black-box prompt-based learning. "

In recent years, there have been many social robots and chatbots that fake emotions or behave deceptively with their users. In this paper, I present a few examples of such robots and chatbots, and analyze their ethical aspects. Three scenarios are presented where some kind of lying or deceptive behaviour might be justified. Then five approaches to deceptive behaviours - no deception, blatant deception, tactful deception, nudging, and self deception - are discussed and their implications are analyzed. I conclude by arguing that we need to develop localized and culture-specific solutions to incorporating deception in social robots and chatbots. "

One important factor in its success is a verbalizer, which translates output from a language model into a predicted class. Notably, the simplest and widely acknowledged verbalizer employs manual labels to represent the classes. However, manual selection does not guarantee the optimality of the selected words when conditioned on the chosen language model. Therefore, we propose Label-Aware Automatic Verbalizer (LAAV), effectively augmenting the manual labels to achieve better few-shot classification results. Specifically, we use the manual labels along with the conjunction ""and"" to induce the model to generate more effective words for the verbalizer. The experimental results on five datasets across five languages demonstrate that LAAV significantly outperforms existing verbalizers. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that LAAV suggests more relevant words compared to similar approaches, especially in mid-to-low resource languages. "

To demystify this long-standing challenge, this work seeks to develop a theoretical framework by characterizing the shape of the accuracy-fairness trade-off Pareto frontier (FairFrontier), determined by a set of all optimal Pareto classifiers that no other classifiers can dominate. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of the trade-off in real-world scenarios and then propose four potential categories to characterize the important properties of the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier. For each category, we identify the necessary conditions that lead to corresponding trade-offs. Experimental results on synthetic data suggest insightful findings of the proposed framework: (1) When sensitive attributes can be fully interpreted by non-sensitive attributes, FairFrontier is mostly continuous. (2) Accuracy can suffer a \textit{sharp} decline when over-pursuing fairness. (3) Eliminate the trade-off via a two-step streamlined approach. The proposed research enables an in-depth understanding of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, pushing current fair machine-learning research to a new frontier. "

Gómez, Julio Sahuquillo",New submissions,"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Performance (cs.PF)","Simultaneous multithreading processors improve throughput over single-threaded processors thanks to sharing internal core resources among instructions from distinct threads. However, resource sharing introduces inter-thread interference within the core, which has a negative impact on individual application performance and can significantly increase the turnaround time of multi-program workloads. The severity of the interference effects depends on the competing co-runners sharing the core. Thus, it can be mitigated by applying a thread-to-core allocation policy that smartly selects applications to be run in the same core to minimize their interference. This paper presents SYNPA, a simple approach that dynamically allocates threads to cores in an SMT processor based on their run-time dynamic behavior. The approach uses a regression model to select synergistic pairs to mitigate intra-core interference. The main novelty of SYNPA is that it uses just three variables collected from the performance counters available in current ARM processors at the dispatch stage. Experimental results show that SYNPA outperforms the default Linux scheduler by around 36%, on average, in terms of turnaround time in 8-application workloads combining frontend bound and backend bound benchmarks.

These phenotypical measurements are essential for developing new crop varieties with the aim of increasing productivity and dealing with environmental challenges such as climate change. However, developing and deploying crop phenotyping robots face many challenges such as complex and variable crop shapes that complicate robotic object detection, dynamic and unstructured environments that baffle robotic control, and real-time computing and managing big data that challenge robotic hardware/software. This work specifically tackles the first challenge by proposing a novel Digital-Twin(DT)MARS-CycleGAN model for image augmentation to improve our Modular Agricultural Robotic System (MARS)'s crop object detection from complex and variable backgrounds. Our core idea is that in addition to the cycle consistency losses in the CycleGAN model, we designed and enforced a new DT-MARS loss in the deep learning model to penalize the inconsistency between real crop images captured by MARS and synthesized images sensed by DT MARS. Therefore, the generated synthesized crop images closely mimic real images in terms of realism, and they are employed to fine-tune object detectors such as YOLOv8. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our new DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework significantly boosts our MARS' crop object/row detector's performance, contributing to the field of robotic crop phenotyping.

Benefiting from the prior knowledge illustrated by the seen anomalies, current OSAD methods can often largely reduce false positive errors. However, these methods treat the anomaly examples as from a homogeneous distribution, rendering them less effective in generalizing to unseen anomalies that can be drawn from any distribution. In this paper, we propose to learn heterogeneous anomaly distributions using the limited anomaly examples to address this issue. To this end, we introduce a novel approach, namely Anomaly Heterogeneity Learning (AHL), that simulates a diverse set of heterogeneous (seen and unseen) anomaly distributions and then utilizes them to learn a unified heterogeneous abnormality model. Further, AHL is a generic framework that existing OSAD models can plug and play for enhancing their abnormality modeling. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AHL can 1) substantially enhance different state-of-the-art (SOTA) OSAD models in detecting both seen and unseen anomalies, achieving new SOTA performance on a large set of datasets, and 2) effectively generalize to unseen anomalies in new target domains.

This improves over previous work by a factor of $\Eps$, and is optimal up to a factor of $\log \Eps$. Such a set of LSOs has the property that for any two points, $\p, \q \in [0,1]^d$, there exist an order in the set such that all the points between $\p$ and $\q$ in the order are $\eps$-close to either $\p$ or $\q$. The existence of such LSOs is a fundamental property of low dimensional Euclidean space, conceptually similar to the existence of well-separated pairs decomposition, so the question of how to compute (near) optimal construction of LSOs is quite natural. As a consequence we get a flotilla of improved dynamic geometric algorithms, such as maintaining bichromatic closest pair, and spanners, among others. In particular, for geometric dynamic spanners the new result matches (up to the aforementioned $\log \Eps$ factor) the lower bound, Thus offering a near-optimal simple dynamic data-structure for maintaining spanners under insertions and deletions.

As a result, it is unclear how such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This is a concerning omission as such distribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To address this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to comprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts (i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts (i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess 706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale analysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD generalization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness, in a positive linear way, under many distribution shifts. The latter enables the prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. Based on this, we are able to predict the upper limit of OOD robustness for existing robust training schemes. The results suggest that achieving OOD robustness requires designing novel methods beyond the conventional ones. Last, we discover that extra data, data augmentation, advanced model architectures and particular regularization approaches can improve OOD robustness. Noticeably, the discovered training schemes, compared to the baseline, exhibit dramatically higher robustness under threat shift while keeping high ID robustness, demonstrating new promising solutions for robustness against both multi-attack and unforeseen attacks.

However, the transfer is not equally successful for all languages, especially for low-resource ones, which poses an ongoing challenge. It is unclear whether we have reached the limits of implicit cross-lingual generalization and if explicit knowledge transfer is viable. In this paper, we investigate the potential for explicitly aligning conceptual correspondence between languages to enhance cross-lingual generalization. Using the syntactic aspect of language as a testbed, our analyses of 43 languages reveal a high degree of alignability among the spaces of structural concepts within each language for both encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs. We then propose a meta-learning-based method to learn to align conceptual spaces of different languages, which facilitates zero-shot and few-shot generalization in concept classification and also offers insights into the cross-lingual in-context learning phenomenon. Experiments on syntactic analysis tasks show that our approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and narrows the performance gap between languages, particularly benefiting those with limited resources.

Self-triggering mechanisms (STMs) are widely used in MASs, thanks to their advantages in avoiding continuous monitoring and saving computing and communication resources. However, existing results require the knowledge of system matrices, which are difficult to obtain in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we present a data-driven approach to designing STMs for unknown MASs building upon the model-based solutions. Our approach leverages a system lifting method, which allows us to derive a data-driven representation for the MAS. Subsequently, a data-driven self-triggered consensus control (STC) scheme is designed, which combines a data-driven STM with a state feedback control law. We establish a data-based stability criterion for asymptotic consensus of the closed-loop MAS in terms of linear matrix inequalities, whose solution provides a matrix for the STM as well as a stabilizing controller gain. In the presence of external disturbances, a model-based STC scheme is put forth for $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-consensus of MASs, serving as a baseline for the data-driven STC. Numerical tests are conducted to validate the correctness of the data- and model-based STC approaches. Our data-driven approach demonstrates a superior trade-off between control performance and communication efficiency from finite, noisy data relative to the system identification-based one. "

However, they inherently lack 2D graph perception - a critical ability of human professionals in comprehending molecules' topological structures. To bridge this gap, we propose MolCA: Molecular Graph-Language Modeling with Cross-Modal Projector and Uni-Modal Adapter. MolCA enables an LM (e.g., Galactica) to understand both text- and graph-based molecular contents via the cross-modal projector. Specifically, the cross-modal projector is implemented as a Q-Former to connect a graph encoder's representation space and an LM's text space. Further, MolCA employs a uni-modal adapter (i.e., LoRA) for the LM's efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. Unlike previous studies that couple an LM with a graph encoder via cross-modal contrastive learning, MolCA retains the LM's ability of open-ended text generation and augments it with 2D graph information. To showcase its effectiveness, we extensively benchmark MolCA on tasks of molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction, and molecule-text retrieval, on which MolCA significantly outperforms the baselines.

To tackle this issue and expedite the judicial process, the proposition of an automated system capable of suggesting case outcomes based on factual evidence and precedent from past cases gains significance. This research paper centres on developing a graph neural network-based model to address the Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) problem, recognizing the intrinsic graph structure of judicial cases and making it a binary node classification problem. We explored various embeddings as model features, while nodes such as time nodes and judicial acts were added and pruned to evaluate the model's performance. The study is done while considering the ethical dimension of fairness in these predictions, considering gender and name biases. A link prediction task is also conducted to assess the model's proficiency in anticipating connections between two specified nodes. By harnessing the capabilities of graph neural networks and incorporating fairness analyses, this research aims to contribute insights towards streamlining the adjudication process, enhancing judicial efficiency, and fostering a more equitable legal landscape, ultimately alleviating the strain imposed by mounting case backlogs. Our best-performing model with XLNet pre-trained embeddings as its features gives the macro F1 score of 75% for the LJP task.

In this work, we propose to use counterfactual data augmentation, guided by knowledge of the causal structure of the data, to simulate interventions on spurious features and to learn more robust text classifiers. We show that this strategy is appropriate in prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute. Under the assumptions of such problems, we discuss the favorable sample complexity of counterfactual data augmentation, compared to importance re-weighting. Pragmatically, we match examples using auxiliary data, based on diff-in-diff methodology, and use a large language model (LLM) to represent a conditional probability of text. Through extensive experimentation on learning caregiver-invariant predictors of clinical diagnoses from medical narratives and on semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate that our method for simulating interventions improves out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to baseline invariant learning algorithms.

This implies that we can identify how the problems are inherited, rank the causes to help prioritize fixes, simplify a complex problem and visualize them. In the context of machine learning (ML), one can use cause-to-effect analysis to understand the reason for the biased behavior of the system. For example, we can examine the root causes of biases by checking each feature for a potential cause of bias in the model. To approach this, one can apply small changes to a given feature or a pair of features in the data, following some guidelines and observing how it impacts the decision made by the model (i.e., model prediction). Therefore, we can use cause-to-effect analysis to identify the potential bias-inducing features, even when these features are originally are unknown. This is important since most current methods require a pre-identification of sensitive features for bias assessment and can actually miss other relevant bias-inducing features, which is why systematic identification of such features is necessary. Moreover, it often occurs that to achieve an equitable outcome, one has to take into account sensitive features in the model decision. Therefore, it should be up to the domain experts to decide based on their knowledge of the context of a decision whether bias induced by specific features is acceptable or not. In this study, we propose an approach for systematically identifying all bias-inducing features of a model to help support the decision-making of domain experts. We evaluated our technique using four well-known datasets to showcase how our contribution can help spearhead the standard procedure when developing, testing, maintaining, and deploying fair/equitable machine learning systems.

We propose to learn a coherent forecast for millions of time series with a single bottom-level forecast model by using a sparse loss function that directly optimizes the hierarchical product and/or temporal structure. The benefit of our sparse hierarchical loss function is that it provides practitioners a method of producing bottom-level forecasts that are coherent to any chosen cross-sectional or temporal hierarchy. In addition, removing the need for a post-processing step as required in traditional hierarchical forecasting techniques reduces the computational cost of the prediction phase in the forecasting pipeline. On the public M5 dataset, our sparse hierarchical loss function performs up to 10% (RMSE) better compared to the baseline loss function. We implement our sparse hierarchical loss function within an existing forecasting model at bol, a large European e-commerce platform, resulting in an improved forecasting performance of 2% at the product level. Finally, we found an increase in forecasting performance of about 5-10% when evaluating the forecasting performance across the cross-sectional hierarchies that we defined. These results demonstrate the usefulness of our sparse hierarchical loss applied to a production forecasting system at a major e-commerce platform. "

However, existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a general framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks, which are discussed in research papers and blog posts, are special cases in our framework. Our framework enables us to design a new attack by combining existing attacks.

Research studies have shown that 2D and 3D features are complementary for point cloud segmentation. However, existing methods require extra 2D annotations to achieve 2D-3D information fusion. Considering the high annotation cost of point clouds, effective 2D and 3D feature fusion based on weakly supervised learning is in great demand. To this end, we propose a transformer model with two encoders and one decoder for weakly supervised point cloud segmentation using only scene-level class tags. Specifically, the two encoders compute the self-attended features for 3D point clouds and 2D multi-view images, respectively. The decoder implements interlaced 2D-3D cross-attention and carries out implicit 2D and 3D feature fusion. We alternately switch the roles of queries and key-value pairs in the decoder layers. It turns out that the 2D and 3D features are iteratively enriched by each other.

Learning-based subgoal search methods have shown promise in tackling these problems, but they often suffer from a lack of completeness guarantees, meaning that they may fail to find a solution even if one exists. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to augment a subgoal search method to achieve completeness in discrete action spaces. Specifically, we augment the high-level search with low-level actions to execute a multi-level (hybrid) search, which we call complete subgoal search. This solution achieves the best of both worlds: the practical efficiency of high-level search and the completeness of low-level search. We apply the proposed search method to a recently proposed subgoal search algorithm and evaluate the algorithm trained on offline data on complex planning problems. We demonstrate that our complete subgoal search not only guarantees completeness but can even improve performance in terms of search expansions for instances that the high-level could solve without low-level augmentations. Our approach makes it possible to apply subgoal-level planning for systems where completeness is a critical requirement. "

Gesture descriptions are formulated based on hand landmark coordinates from gesture videos and fed into our dual-agent dialogue system. A gesture agent deciphers these descriptions and queries about the interaction context (e.g., interface, history, gaze data), which a context agent organizes and provides. Following iterative exchanges, the gesture agent discerns user intent, grounding it to an interactive function. We validated the gesture description module using public first-view and third-view gesture datasets and tested the whole system in two real-world settings: video streaming and smart home IoT control.

AgentTuning is used to instruction-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in AgentLM. Our evaluations show that AgentTuning enables LLMs' agent capabilities without compromising general abilities. The AgentLM-70B is comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo on unseen agent tasks, demonstrating generalized agent capabilities. We open source the AgentInstruct and AgentLM-7B, 13B, and 70B models at https://github.com/THUDM/AgentTuning , serving open and powerful alternatives to commercial LLMs for agent tasks. "

We propose a privacy formalism, per-record zero concentrated differential privacy (PzCDP), where the privacy loss associated with each record is a public function of that record's value. Unlike other formalisms which provide different privacy losses to different records, PzCDP's privacy loss depends explicitly on the confidential data. We define our formalism, derive its properties, and propose mechanisms which satisfy PzCDP that are uniquely suited to publishing skewed or heavy-tailed statistics, where a small number of records contribute substantially to query answers. This targeted relaxation helps overcome the difficulties of applying standard DP to these data products. "

A notable example is Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), where planners iteratively determine paths to groups of vertices within the exploration area. However, maintaining a consistent batch size is crucial for initial pathfinding and optimal performance, relying on effective task allocation. This paper introduces Flexible Informed Tree (FIT*), a novel planner integrating an adaptive batch-size method to enhance task scheduling in various environments. FIT* employs a flexible approach in adjusting batch sizes dynamically based on the inherent complexity of the planning domain and the current n-dimensional hyperellipsoid of the system. By constantly optimizing batch sizes, FIT* achieves improved computational efficiency and scalability while maintaining solution quality. This adaptive batch-size method significantly enhances the planner's ability to handle diverse and evolving problem domains. FIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R^2 to R^8, and was demonstrated in real-world environments with KI-Fabrik/DARKO-Project Europe. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 271,Deep Metric Imitation Learning for Stable Motion Primitives,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12831,"Rodrigo Pérez-Dattari, Cosimo Della Santina, Jens Kober",New submissions,Robotics (cs.RO),"Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful technique for intuitive robotic programming. However, ensuring the reliability of learned behaviors remains a challenge. In the context of reaching motions, a robot should consistently reach its goal, regardless of its initial conditions. To meet this requirement, IL methods often employ specialized function approximators that guarantee this property by construction. Although effective, these approaches come with a set of limitations: 1) they are unable to fully exploit the capabilities of modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, 2) some are restricted in the family of motions they can model, resulting in suboptimal IL capabilities, and 3) they require explicit extensions to account for the geometry of motions that consider orientations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel stability loss function, drawing inspiration from the triplet loss used in the deep metric learning literature. This loss does not constrain the DNN's architecture and enables learning policies that yield accurate results. Furthermore, it is easily adaptable to the geometry of the robot's state space. We provide a proof of the stability properties induced by this loss and empirically validate our method in various settings. These settings include Euclidean and non-Euclidean state spaces, as well as first-order and second-order motions, both in simulation and with real robots.

Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be utilized to reduce the power consumption of all-digital basestation (BS) designs. However, simultaneously transmitting user equipments (UEs) with vastly different BS-side receive powers either drown weak UEs in quantization noise or saturate the ADCs. To address this issue, we propose high dynamic range (HDR) MIMO, a new paradigm that enables simultaneous reception of strong and weak UEs with low-resolution ADCs. HDR MIMO combines an adaptive analog spatial transform with digital equalization: The spatial transform focuses strong UEs on a subset of ADCs in order to mitigate quantization and saturation artifacts; digital equalization is then used for data detection. We demonstrate the efficacy of HDR MIMO in a massive MU-MIMO mmWave scenario that uses Householder reflections as spatial transform. "

Park, Sung Ju Hwang",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Recent Language Models (LMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating texts with the knowledge internalized in parameters. Yet, LMs often generate the factually incorrect responses to the given queries, since their knowledge may be inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated. To address this problem, previous works propose to augment LMs with the knowledge retrieved from an external knowledge source. However, such approaches often show suboptimal text generation performance due to two reasons: 1) the model may fail to retrieve the knowledge relevant to the given query, or 2) the model may not faithfully reflect the retrieved knowledge in the generated text. To overcome these, we propose to verify the output and the knowledge of the knowledge-augmented LMs with a separate verifier, which is a small LM that is trained to detect those two types of errors through instruction-finetuning. Then, when the verifier recognizes an error, we can rectify it by either retrieving new knowledge or generating new text. Further, we use an ensemble of the outputs from different instructions with a single verifier to enhance the reliability of the verification processes. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed verification steps on multiple question answering benchmarks, whose results show that the proposed verifier effectively identifies retrieval and generation errors, allowing LMs to provide more factually correct outputs.

In practical physical modeling within these domains, the systems often generate high-index DAEs. Classical implicit numerical methods typically result in varying order reduction of numerical accuracy when solving high-index systems.~Recently, the physics-informed neural network (PINN) has gained attention for solving DAE systems. However, it faces challenges like the inability to directly solve high-index systems, lower predictive accuracy, and weaker generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a PINN computational framework, combined Radau IIA numerical method with a neural network structure via the attention mechanisms, to directly solve high-index DAEs. Furthermore, we employ a domain decomposition strategy to enhance solution accuracy. We conduct numerical experiments with two classical high-index systems as illustrative examples, investigating how different orders of the Radau IIA method affect the accuracy of neural network solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the PINN based on a 5th-order Radau IIA method achieves the highest level of system accuracy. Specifically, the absolute errors for all differential variables remains as low as $10^{-6}$, and the absolute errors for algebraic variables is maintained at $10^{-5}$, surpassing the results found in existing literature. Therefore, our method exhibits excellent computational accuracy and strong generalization capabilities, providing a feasible approach for the high-precision solution of larger-scale DAEs with higher indices or challenging high-dimensional partial differential algebraic equation systems.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method. "

This research explores the integration of deep learning techniques in speech emotion recognition, offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges associated with speaker diarization and emotion identification. It introduces a framework that combines a pre-existing speaker diarization pipeline and an emotion identification model built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve higher precision. The proposed model was trained on data from five speech emotion datasets, namely, RAVDESS, CREMA-D, SAVEE, TESS, and Movie Clips, out of which the latter is a speech emotion dataset created specifically for this research. The features extracted from each sample include Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Root Mean Square (RMS), and various data augmentation algorithms like pitch, noise, stretch, and shift.

We select three large language models (GPT-3.5, text-davinci and Flan-T5) and three datasets - HateXplain, implicit hate and ToxicSpans. We find that on average including the target information in the pipeline improves the model performance substantially (~20-30%) over the baseline across the datasets. There is also a considerable effect of adding the rationales/explanations into the pipeline (~10-20%) over the baseline across the datasets. In addition, we further provide a typology of the error cases where these large language models fail to (i) classify and (ii) explain the reason for the decisions they take. Such vulnerable points automatically constitute 'jailbreak' prompts for these models and industry scale safeguard techniques need to be developed to make the models robust against such prompts. "

We propose a simple and general method that is applicable to various deep generative models and robotic environments. The key idea is to quickly fine-tune the model by fitting it to generated samples matching the observed evidence, using the cross-entropy method.

However, the scarcity of high-quality labeled data always presents significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by developing controllable diffusion models for medical image synthesis, called EMIT-Diff. We leverage recent diffusion probabilistic models to generate realistic and diverse synthetic medical image data that preserve the essential characteristics of the original medical images by incorporating edge information of objects to guide the synthesis process. In our approach, we ensure that the synthesized samples adhere to medically relevant constraints and preserve the underlying structure of imaging data. Due to the random sampling process by the diffusion model, we can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic images with diverse appearances. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an extensive set of medical image segmentation experiments on multiple datasets, including Ultrasound breast (+13.87%), CT spleen (+0.38%), and MRI prostate (+7.78%), achieving significant improvements over the baseline segmentation methods. For the first time, to our best knowledge, the promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our EMIT-Diff for medical image segmentation tasks and show the feasibility of introducing a first-ever text-guided diffusion model for general medical image segmentation tasks. With carefully designed ablation experiments, we investigate the influence of various data augmentation ratios, hyper-parameter settings, patch size for generating random merging mask settings, and combined influence with different network architectures.

We study two hybrid schemes, both built upon the Hybrid High-Order technology. The first one hinges on exponential fitting and is linear, whereas the second is nonlinear. The existence of solutions is established for both schemes. Both schemes are also shown to enjoy a discrete entropy structure, ensuring that the discrete long-time behaviour of solutions mimics the PDE one. The nonlinear scheme is designed so as to enforce the positivity of discrete solutions. On the contrary, we display numerical evidence indicating that the linear scheme violates positivity, whatever the order. Finally, we verify numerically that the nonlinear scheme has optimal order of convergence, expected long-time behaviour, and that raising the polynomial degree results, also in the nonlinear case, in an efficiency gain.

In this new era of intelligent infrastructure and facilities, it is evident that cyber-security has recently received the most significant attention from the seaport and maritime authorities, and it is a primary concern on the agenda of most ports. Traditional security solutions can be applied to safeguard IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) from harmful entities. Nevertheless, security researchers can only watch, examine, and learn about the behaviors of attackers if these solutions operate more transparently. Herein, honeypots are potential solutions since they offer valuable information about the attackers. It can be virtual or physical. Virtual honeypots must be more realistic to entice attackers, necessitating better high-fidelity. To this end, Digital Twin (DT) technology can be employed to increase the complexity and simulation fidelity of the honeypots. Seaports can be attacked from both their existing devices and external devices at the same time. Existing mechanisms are insufficient to detect external attacks; therefore, the current systems cannot handle attacks at the desired level. DT and honeypot technologies can be used together to tackle them. Consequently, we suggest a DT-assisted honeypot, called TwinPot, for external attacks in smart seaports. Moreover, we propose an intelligent attack detection mechanism to handle different attack types using DT for internal attacks. Finally, we build an extensive smart seaport dataset for internal and external attacks using the MANSIM tool and two existing datasets to test the performance of our system. We show that under simultaneous internal and external attacks on the system, our solution successfully detects internal and external attacks. "

Existing methods to estimate arousal and valence rely on learning from data sets, where an expert annotator labels every image frame. Access to an expert annotator is not always possible, and the annotation can also be tedious. Hence it is more practical to obtain self-reported arousal and valence values directly from the human in a real-time Human-Robot collaborative setting. Hence this paper provides an emotion data set (HRI-AVC) obtained while conducting a human-robot interaction (HRI) task. The self-reported pair of labels in this data set is associated with a set of image frames. This paper also proposes a spatial and temporal attention-based network to estimate arousal and valence from this set of image frames. The results show that an attention-based network can estimate valence and arousal on the HRI-AVC data set even when Arousal and Valence values are unavailable per frame. "

The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length. A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any \emph{polynomial code}, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.

Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and $t$, the connectivity $\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$. Much research has gone into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau, and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\omega \in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the related problem of computing ""small connectivities,"" it was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\min(k,\lambda(s,t))$ for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023]. In this paper, we present an alternate exposition of these $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ and $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time algorithms, with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing an elegant but ad hoc ""flow vector framework"" for showing correctness of these algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero. This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms. "

We first define new quantitative measures of absolute and relative equivalence in system performance, capturing disparities across languages and within individual languages. Through a series of controlled experiments, we demonstrate that performance disparities depend on a number of factors: the nature of the ToD task at hand, the underlying pretrained language model, the target language, and the amount of ToD annotated data. We empirically prove the existence of the adaptation and intrinsic biases in current ToD systems: e.g., ToD systems trained for Arabic or Turkish using annotated ToD data fully parallel to English ToD data still exhibit diminished ToD task performance. Beyond providing a series of insights into the performance disparities of ToD systems in different languages, our analyses offer practical tips on how to approach ToD data collection and system development for new languages.

Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem). By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column. We then generalize the techniques of GZ and AGL to show that both these relaxations can be constructed over constant size fields by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi. We obtain the following corollaries from our main result. First, randomly punctured AG codes of rate $R$ achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$. Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity. Second, by randomly puncturing AG codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.

We explored how a robot's unexpected behaviors affect child-robot interactions during two workshops on active reading: one in a modern art museum and one in a school. We observed the behavior and attitudes of 42 children from three age groups: 6-7 years, 8-10 years, and 10-12 years. Through our observations, we identified six different types of surprising robot behaviors: personality, movement malfunctions, inconsistent behavior, mispronunciation, delays, and freezing. Using a qualitative analysis, we examined how children responded to each type of behavior, and we observed similarities and differences between the age groups. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for designing age-appropriate learning interactions with social robots. "

We adopted a personalized model to predict the individual's movement trajectory from their data, instead of predicting from the overall movement, based on the hypothesis that human movement is unique to each person. We devised the features such as the date and time, activity time, days of the week, time of day, and frequency of visits to POI (Point of Interest). As additional features, we incorporated the movement of other individuals with similar behavior patterns through the employment of clustering. The machine learning model we adopted was the Support Vector Regression (SVR). We performed accuracy through offline assessment and carried out feature selection and parameter tuning. Although overall dataset provided consists of 100,000 users trajectory, our method use only 20,000 target users data, and do not need to use other 80,000 data. Despite the personalized model's traditional feature engineering approach, this model yields reasonably good accuracy with lower computational cost. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 294,Experimental Narratives: A Comparison of Human Crowdsourced Storytelling  and AI Storytelling,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12902,Nina Begus,New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"The paper proposes a framework that combines behavioral and computational experiments employing fictional prompts as a novel tool for investigating cultural artifacts and social biases in storytelling both by humans and generative AI. The study analyzes 250 stories authored by crowdworkers in June 2019 and 80 stories generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in March 2023 by merging methods from narratology and inferential statistics. Both crowdworkers and large language models responded to identical prompts about creating and falling in love with an artificial human. The proposed experimental paradigm allows a direct comparison between human and LLM-generated storytelling. Responses to the Pygmalionesque prompts confirm the pervasive presence of the Pygmalion myth in the collective imaginary of both humans and large language models. All solicited narratives present a scientific or technological pursuit. The analysis reveals that narratives from GPT-3.5 and particularly GPT-4 are more more progressive in terms of gender roles and sexuality than those written by humans. While AI narratives can occasionally provide innovative plot twists, they offer less imaginative scenarios and rhetoric than human-authored texts. The proposed framework argues that fiction can be used as a window into human and AI-based collective imaginary and social dimensions. "

Being able to discover objects in images/videos without knowing in advance what objects populate the dataset is an exciting prospect. But how to find objects without knowing anything about them? Recent works show that it is possible to perform class-agnostic unsupervised object localization by exploiting self-supervised pre-trained features. We propose here a survey of unsupervised object localization methods that discover objects in images without requiring any manual annotation in the era of self-supervised ViTs. We gather links of discussed methods in the repository https://github.com/valeoai/Awesome-Unsupervised-Object-Localization. 
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 296,Collaborative Adaptation: Learning to Recover from Unforeseen  Malfunctions in Multi-Robot Teams,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12909,"Yasin Findik, Paul Robinette, Kshitij Jerath, S. Reza Ahmadzadeh",New submissions,Robotics (cs.RO); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),"Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches tackle the challenge of finding effective multi-agent cooperation strategies for accomplishing individual or shared objectives in multi-agent teams. In real-world scenarios, however, agents may encounter unforeseen failures due to constraints like battery depletion or mechanical issues. Existing state-of-the-art methods in MARL often recover slowly -- if at all -- from such malfunctions once agents have already converged on a cooperation strategy. To address this gap, we present the Collaborative Adaptation (CA) framework. CA introduces a mechanism that guides collaboration and accelerates adaptation from unforeseen failures by leveraging inter-agent relationships. Our findings demonstrate that CA enables agents to act on the knowledge of inter-agent relations, recovering from unforeseen agent failures and selecting appropriate cooperative strategies. "

Reza Ahmadzadeh",New submissions,Robotics (cs.RO); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),"Relational networks within a team play a critical role in the performance of many real-world multi-robot systems. To successfully accomplish tasks that require cooperation and coordination, different agents (e.g., robots) necessitate different priorities based on their positioning within the team. Yet, many of the existing multi-robot cooperation algorithms regard agents as interchangeable and lack a mechanism to guide the type of cooperation strategy the agents should exhibit. To account for the team structure in cooperative tasks, we propose a novel algorithm that uses a relational network comprising inter-agent relationships to prioritize certain agents over others. Through appropriate design of the team's relational network, we can guide the cooperation strategy, resulting in the emergence of new behaviors that accomplish the specified task. We conducted six experiments in a multi-robot setting with a cooperative task. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively influence the type of solution that the algorithm converges to by specifying the relationships between the agents, making it a promising approach for tasks that require cooperation among agents with a specified team structure.

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 298,"Tight approximability of MAX 2-SAT and relatives, under UGC",https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12911,"Joshua Brakensiek, Neng Huang, Uri Zwick",New submissions,Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"Austrin showed that the approximation ratio $\beta\approx 0.94016567$ obtained by the MAX 2-SAT approximation algorithm of Lewin, Livnat and Zwick (LLZ) is optimal modulo the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) and modulo a Simplicity Conjecture that states that the worst performance of the algorithm is obtained on so called simple configurations. We prove Austrin's conjecture, thereby showing the optimality of the LLZ approximation algorithm, relying only on the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proof uses a combination of analytic and computational tools. We also present new approximation algorithms for two restrictions of the MAX 2-SAT problem. For MAX HORN-$\{1,2\}$-SAT, i.e., MAX CSP$(\{x\lor y,\bar{x}\lor y,x,\bar{x}\})$, in which clauses are not allowed to contain two negated literals, we obtain an approximation ratio of $0.94615981$. For MAX CSP$(\{x\lor y,x,\bar{x}\})$, i.e., when 2-clauses are not allowed to contain negated literals, we obtain an approximation ratio of $0.95397990$. By adapting Austrin's and our arguments for the MAX 2-SAT problem we show that these two approximation ratios are also tight, modulo only the UGC conjecture. This completes a full characterization of the approximability of the MAX 2-SAT problem and its restrictions. "

Reza Ahmadzadeh",New submissions,Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Robotics (cs.RO),"Effective coordination and cooperation among agents are crucial for accomplishing individual or shared objectives in multi-agent systems. In many real-world multi-agent systems, agents possess varying abilities and constraints, making it necessary to prioritize agents based on their specific properties to ensure successful coordination and cooperation within the team. However, most existing cooperative multi-agent algorithms do not take into account these individual differences, and lack an effective mechanism to guide coordination strategies. We propose a novel multi-agent learning approach that incorporates relationship awareness into value-based factorization methods. Given a relational network, our approach utilizes inter-agents relationships to discover new team behaviors by prioritizing certain agents over other, accounting for differences between them in cooperative tasks. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed approach by conducting fifteen experiments in two different environments. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can influence and shape team behavior, guide cooperation strategies, and expedite agent learning. Therefore, our approach shows promise for use in multi-agent systems, especially when agents have diverse properties. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 300,Deterministic 3SUM-Hardness,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12913,"Nick Fischer, Piotr Kaliciak, Adam Polak",New submissions,Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"As one of the three main pillars of fine-grained complexity theory, the 3SUM problem explains the hardness of many diverse polynomial-time problems via fine-grained reductions. Many of these reductions are either directly based on or heavily inspired by P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu's framework involving additive hashing and are thus randomized. Some selected reductions were derandomized in previous work [Chan, He; SOSA'20], but the current techniques are limited and a major fraction of the reductions remains randomized. In this work we gather a toolkit aimed to derandomize reductions based on additive hashing. Using this toolkit, we manage to derandomize almost all known 3SUM-hardness reductions. As technical highlights we derandomize the hardness reductions to (offline) Set Disjointness, (offline) Set Intersection and Triangle Listing -- these questions were explicitly left open in previous work [Kopelowitz, Pettie, Porat; SODA'16]. The few exceptions to our work fall into a special category of recent reductions based on structure-versus-randomness dichotomies. We expect that our toolkit can be readily applied to derandomize future reductions as well. As a conceptual innovation, our work thereby promotes the theory of deterministic 3SUM-hardness. As our second contribution, we prove that there is a deterministic universe reduction for 3SUM. Specifically, using additive hashing it is a standard trick to assume that the numbers in 3SUM have size at most $n^3$. We prove that this assumption is similarly valid for deterministic algorithms.

Besides, the security architecture of software-defined sensor networks needs to pay attention to the vulnerabilities of both software-defined networks and sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a network-aware automated machine learning (AutoML) framework which detects DDoS attacks in software-defined sensor networks. Our framework selects an ideal machine learning algorithm to detect DDoS attacks in network-constrained environments, using metrics such as variable traffic load, heterogeneous traffic rate, and detection time while preventing over-fitting. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) we first investigate the trade-off between the efficiency of ML algorithms and network/traffic state in the scope of DDoS detection. (ii) we design and implement a software architecture containing open-source network tools, with the deployment of multiple ML algorithms. Lastly, we show that under the denial of service attacks, our framework ensures the traffic packets are still delivered within the network with additional delays. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 302,Generative Marginalization Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12920,"Sulin Liu, Peter J. Ramadge, Ryan P. Adams",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"We introduce marginalization models (MaMs), a new family of generative models for high-dimensional discrete data. They offer scalable and flexible generative modeling with tractable likelihoods by explicitly modeling all induced marginal distributions. Marginalization models enable fast evaluation of arbitrary marginal probabilities with a single forward pass of the neural network, which overcomes a major limitation of methods with exact marginal inference, such as autoregressive models (ARMs). We propose scalable methods for learning the marginals, grounded in the concept of ""marginalization self-consistency"". Unlike previous methods, MaMs support scalable training of any-order generative models for high-dimensional problems under the setting of energy-based training, where the goal is to match the learned distribution to a given desired probability (specified by an unnormalized (log) probability function such as energy function or reward function). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a variety of discrete data distributions, including binary images, language, physical systems, and molecules, for maximum likelihood and energy-based training settings. MaMs achieve orders of magnitude speedup in evaluating the marginal probabilities on both settings. For energy-based training tasks, MaMs enable any-order generative modeling of high-dimensional problems beyond the capability of previous methods. Code is at https://github.com/PrincetonLIPS/MaM. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 303,Vision-Language Models are Zero-Shot Reward Models for Reinforcement  Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12921,"Juan Rocamonde, Victoriano Montesinos, Elvis Nava, Ethan Perez, David Lindner",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Reinforcement learning (RL) requires either manually specifying a reward function, which is often infeasible, or learning a reward model from a large amount of human feedback, which is often very expensive. We study a more sample-efficient alternative: using pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot reward models (RMs) to specify tasks via natural language. We propose a natural and general approach to using VLMs as reward models, which we call VLM-RMs. We use VLM-RMs based on CLIP to train a MuJoCo humanoid to learn complex tasks without a manually specified reward function, such as kneeling, doing the splits, and sitting in a lotus position. For each of these tasks, we only provide a single sentence text prompt describing the desired task with minimal prompt engineering. We provide videos of the trained agents at: https://sites.google.com/view/vlm-rm. We can improve performance by providing a second ``baseline'' prompt and projecting out parts of the CLIP embedding space irrelevant to distinguish between goal and baseline. Further, we find a strong scaling effect for VLM-RMs: larger VLMs trained with more compute and data are better reward models. The failure modes of VLM-RMs we encountered are all related to known capability limitations of current VLMs, such as limited spatial reasoning ability or visually unrealistic environments that are far off-distribution for the VLM. We find that VLM-RMs are remarkably robust as long as the VLM is large enough. This suggests that future VLMs will become more and more useful reward models for a wide range of RL applications. "

We implemented a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) model and an automated feature selection (AutoFS) module to handle core network data. We used an online learning approach to update the model instantly and efficiently, improve the learning model quickly, and ensure accurate predictions. Finally, we reveal that our proposed solution successfully detects DDoS attacks and updates the feature selection method and learning model with a true classification rate of ninety-seven percent. Our proposed solution can estimate the attack within approximately fifteen minutes after the DDoS attack starts. "
2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 305,Resolving social dilemmas with minimal reward transfer,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12928,"Richard Willis, Yali Du, Joel Z Leibo, Michael Luck",New submissions,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"Multi-agent cooperation is an important topic, and is particularly challenging in mixed-motive situations where it does not pay to be nice to others. Consequently, self-interested agents often avoid collective behaviour, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for the group. In response, in this paper we introduce a metric to quantify the disparity between what is rational for individual agents and what is rational for the group, which we call the general self-interest level. This metric represents the maximum proportion of individual rewards that all agents can retain while ensuring that achieving social welfare optimum becomes a dominant strategy. By aligning the individual and group incentives, rational agents acting to maximise their own reward will simultaneously maximise the collective reward. As agents transfer their rewards to motivate others to consider their welfare, we diverge from traditional concepts of altruism or prosocial behaviours. The general self-interest level is a property of a game that is useful for assessing the propensity of players to cooperate and understanding how features of a game impact this. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on several novel games representations of social dilemmas with arbitrary numbers of players. "

The PGM approach makes observable states and actions explicit, as well as beliefs and intentions grounded by evidence about what players see and do over time. This approach also supports inferring the effect of interventions, which are vital if AI agents are to assist human teams. The experiment incorporates manipulations of players' knowledge, and the virtual Minecraft-based testbed provides access to several streams of information, including the objects in the players' field of view. The participants are equipped with a set of marker blocks that can be placed near room entrances to signal the presence or absence of victims in the rooms to their teammates. In each team, one of the members is given a different legend for the markers than the other two, which may mislead them about the state of the rooms; that is, they will hold a false belief. We extend previous works in this field by introducing ToMCAT, an AI agent that can reason about individual and shared mental states. We find that the players' behaviors are affected by what they see in their in-game field of view, their beliefs about the meaning of the markers, and their beliefs about which meaning the team decided to adopt. In addition, we show that ToMCAT's beliefs are consistent with the players' actions and that it can infer false beliefs with accuracy significantly better than chance and comparable to inferences made by human observers.

However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.

GFlowNets exploit the sequential nature of the problem, drawing parallels with reinforcement learning (RL). Our work extends the connection between RL and GFlowNets to a general case. We demonstrate how the task of learning a generative flow network can be efficiently redefined as an entropy-regularized RL problem with a specific reward and regularizer structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical efficiency of this reformulation by applying standard soft RL algorithms to GFlowNet training across several probabilistic modeling tasks. Contrary to previously reported results, we show that entropic RL approaches can be competitive against established GFlowNet training methods. This perspective opens a direct path for integrating reinforcement learning principles into the realm of generative flow networks. "

Our construction mimics that of Maddux (2010) where a relational representation of the even Sugihara chains is given. An order automorphism between the two copies of the rationals is the key to ensuring that the identity element of the monoid is fixed by the involution.

It remains unclear as to which of those factors influence social biases that are learned by MLMs. To study the relationship between model factors and the social biases learned by an MLM, as well as the downstream task performance of the model, we conduct a comprehensive study over 39 pretrained MLMs covering different model sizes, training objectives, tokenization methods, training data domains and languages.

Secondly, to enhance the long-term performance of inference systems, we formulate a multi-slot stochastic E2E delay optimization problem that jointly considers model partitioning and multi-dimensional resource allocation. Finally, to solve this problem, we introduce a Lyapunov-guided Multi-Dimensional Optimization algorithm (LyMDO) that decouples the original problem into per-slot deterministic problems, where Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and convex optimization are used for joint optimization of partitioning decisions and complementary resource allocation. Simulation results show that our approach effectively improves E2E delay while balancing long-term resource constraints. "

While the societal impact of foundation models is growing, transparency is on the decline, mirroring the opacity that has plagued past digital technologies (e.g. social media). Reversing this trend is essential: transparency is a vital precondition for public accountability, scientific innovation, and effective governance. To assess the transparency of the foundation model ecosystem and help improve transparency over time, we introduce the Foundation Model Transparency Index. The Foundation Model Transparency Index specifies 100 fine-grained indicators that comprehensively codify transparency for foundation models, spanning the upstream resources used to build a foundation model (e.g data, labor, compute), details about the model itself (e.g. size, capabilities, risks), and the downstream use (e.g. distribution channels, usage policies, affected geographies). We score 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Meta) against the 100 indicators to assess their transparency. To facilitate and standardize assessment, we score developers in relation to their practices for their flagship foundation model (e.g. GPT-4 for OpenAI, PaLM 2 for Google, Llama 2 for Meta). We present 10 top-level findings about the foundation model ecosystem: for example, no developer currently discloses significant information about the downstream impact of its flagship model, such as the number of users, affected market sectors, or how users can seek redress for harm. Overall, the Foundation Model Transparency Index establishes the level of transparency today to drive progress on foundation model governance via industry standards and regulatory intervention. "

Siegelmann and Sontag (1992) famously showed that RNNs with rational weights and hidden states and unbounded computation time are Turing complete. However, LMs define weightings over strings in addition to just (unweighted) language membership and the analysis of the computational power of RNN LMs (RLMs) should reflect this. We extend the Turing completeness result to the probabilistic case, showing how a rationally weighted RLM with unbounded computation time can simulate any probabilistic Turing machine (PTM). Since, in practice, RLMs work in real-time, processing a symbol at every time step, we treat the above result as an upper bound on the expressivity of RLMs. We also provide a lower bound by showing that under the restriction to real-time computation, such models can simulate deterministic real-time rational PTMs. "

Nonetheless, it could be a demanding endeavor, given its intricate nature necessitating a deep understanding of rules, algorithms, and parameters. To reduce workload, we introduce 3D-GPT, a framework utilizing large language models~(LLMs) for instruction-driven 3D modeling. 3D-GPT positions LLMs as proficient problem solvers, dissecting the procedural 3D modeling tasks into accessible segments and appointing the apt agent for each task. 3D-GPT integrates three core agents: the task dispatch agent, the conceptualization agent, and the modeling agent. They collaboratively achieve two objectives. First, it enhances concise initial scene descriptions, evolving them into detailed forms while dynamically adapting the text based on subsequent instructions. Second, it integrates procedural generation, extracting parameter values from enriched text to effortlessly interface with 3D software for asset creation. Our empirical investigations confirm that 3D-GPT not only interprets and executes instructions, delivering reliable results but also collaborates effectively with human designers.

To address this limitation, we propose a framework that facilitates the structured generation of design space in which users can seamlessly explore, evaluate, and synthesize a multitude of responses. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of this framework through the design and development of an interactive system, Luminate, and a user study with 8 professional writers.

In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline RL algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit Q-learning (IQL) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand IQL's robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, IQL still suffers from heavy-tail targets of Q functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the Huber loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into IQL, we propose a more robust offline RL approach named Robust IQL (RIQL). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIQL exhibits highly robust performance when subjected to diverse data corruption scenarios. "

Hoffmann, Simon Schrodi, Nadine Behrmann, Volker Fischer, Thomas Brox",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"In this work, we study rapid, step-wise improvements of the loss in transformers when being confronted with multi-step decision tasks. We found that transformers struggle to learn the intermediate tasks, whereas CNNs have no such issue on the tasks we studied. When transformers learn the intermediate task, they do this rapidly and unexpectedly after both training and validation loss saturated for hundreds of epochs. We call these rapid improvements Eureka-moments, since the transformer appears to suddenly learn a previously incomprehensible task. Similar leaps in performance have become known as Grokking. In contrast to Grokking, for Eureka-moments, both the validation and the training loss saturate before rapidly improving. We trace the problem back to the Softmax function in the self-attention block of transformers and show ways to alleviate the problem. These fixes improve training speed. The improved models reach 95% of the baseline model in just 20% of training steps while having a much higher likelihood to learn the intermediate task, lead to higher final accuracy and are more robust to hyper-parameters.

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 319,Local Non-Cooperative Games with Principled Player Selection for  Scalable Motion Planning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12958,"Makram Chahine, Roya Firoozi, Wei Xiao, Mac Schwager, Daniela Rus",New submissions,Robotics (cs.RO); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA),"Game-theoretic motion planners are a powerful tool for the control of interactive multi-agent robot systems. Indeed, contrary to predict-then-plan paradigms, game-theoretic planners do not ignore the interactive nature of the problem, and simultaneously predict the behaviour of other agents while considering change in one's policy. This, however, comes at the expense of computational complexity, especially as the number of agents considered grows. In fact, planning with more than a handful of agents can quickly become intractable, disqualifying game-theoretic planners as possible candidates for large scale planning. In this paper, we propose a planning algorithm enabling the use of game-theoretic planners in robot systems with a large number of agents. Our planner is based on the reality of locality of information and thus deploys local games with a selected subset of agents in a receding horizon fashion to plan collision avoiding trajectories. We propose five different principled schemes for selecting game participants and compare their collision avoidance performance. We observe that the use of Control Barrier Functions for priority ranking is a potent solution to the player selection problem for motion planning. "

Inspired by the success of subgoal-based methods, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{SE}quential sub\textbf{G}oal \textbf{O}ptimization (SEGO) to enhance LLMs' ability to solve mathematical problems. By establishing a connection between the subgoal breakdown process and the probability of solving problems, SEGO aims to identify better subgoals with theoretical guarantees. Addressing the challenge of identifying suitable subgoals in a large solution space, our framework generates problem-specific subgoals and adjusts them according to carefully designed criteria. Incorporating these optimized subgoals into the policy model training leads to significant improvements in problem-solving performance. We validate SEGO's efficacy through experiments on two benchmarks, GSM8K and MATH, where our approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of SEGO in AI-driven mathematical problem-solving.

Manning",New submissions,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Widely used language models (LMs) are typically built by scaling up a two-stage training pipeline: a pre-training stage that uses a very large, diverse dataset of text and a fine-tuning (sometimes, 'alignment') stage that uses targeted examples or other specifications of desired behaviors. While it has been hypothesized that knowledge and skills come from pre-training, and fine-tuning mostly filters this knowledge and skillset, this intuition has not been extensively tested. To aid in doing so, we introduce a novel technique for decoupling the knowledge and skills gained in these two stages, enabling a direct answer to the question, ""What would happen if we combined the knowledge learned by a large model during pre-training with the knowledge learned by a small model during fine-tuning (or vice versa)?"" Using an RL-based framework derived from recent developments in learning from human preferences, we introduce emulated fine-tuning (EFT), a principled and practical method for sampling from a distribution that approximates (or 'emulates') the result of pre-training and fine-tuning at different scales. Our experiments with EFT show that scaling up fine-tuning tends to improve helpfulness, while scaling up pre-training tends to improve factuality. Beyond decoupling scale, we show that EFT enables test-time adjustment of competing behavioral traits like helpfulness and harmlessness without additional training. Finally, a special case of emulated fine-tuning, which we call LM up-scaling, avoids resource-intensive fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by ensembling them with small fine-tuned models, essentially emulating the result of fine-tuning the large pre-trained model. Up-scaling consistently improves helpfulness and factuality of instruction-following models in the Llama, Llama-2, and Falcon families, without additional hyperparameters or training. "

In this work, we present AutoMix, an approach that strategically routes queries to larger LMs, based on the approximate correctness of outputs from a smaller LM. Central to AutoMix is a few-shot self-verification mechanism, which estimates the reliability of its own outputs without requiring training. Given that verifications can be noisy, we employ a meta verifier in AutoMix to refine the accuracy of these assessments. Our experiments using LLAMA2-13/70B, on five context-grounded reasoning datasets demonstrate that AutoMix surpasses established baselines, improving the incremental benefit per cost by up to 89%.

Explainable AI for Bearing Fault  Detection with Deep Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12967,"Thomas Decker, Michael Lebacher, Volker Tresp",New submissions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Deep Learning has already been successfully applied to analyze industrial sensor data in a variety of relevant use cases. However, the opaque nature of many well-performing methods poses a major obstacle for real-world deployment. Explainable AI (XAI) and especially feature attribution techniques promise to enable insights about how such models form their decision. But the plain application of such methods often fails to provide truly informative and problem-specific insights to domain experts. In this work, we focus on the specific task of detecting faults in rolling element bearings from vibration signals. We propose a novel and domain-specific feature attribution framework that allows us to evaluate how well the underlying logic of a model corresponds with expert reasoning. Utilizing the framework we are able to validate the trustworthiness and to successfully anticipate the generalization ability of different well-performing deep learning models. Our methodology demonstrates how signal processing tools can effectively be used to enhance Explainable AI techniques and acts as a template for similar problems. "

Although the convergence of SGDs in the (strongly) convex case is well-understood, their convergence for nonconvex functions stands on weak mathematical foundations. Most existing studies on the nonconvex convergence of SGD show the complexity results based on either the minimum of the expected gradient norm or the functional sub-optimality gap (for functions with extra structural property) by searching the entire range of iterates. Hence the last iterations of SGDs do not necessarily maintain the same complexity guarantee. This paper shows that an $\epsilon$-stationary point exists in the final iterates of SGDs, given a large enough total iteration budget, $T$, not just anywhere in the entire range of iterates -- a much stronger result than the existing one. Additionally, our analyses allow us to measure the density of the $\epsilon$-stationary points in the final iterates of SGD, and we recover the classical $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ asymptotic rate under various existing assumptions on the objective function and the bounds on the stochastic gradient. As a result of our analyses, we addressed certain myths and legends related to the nonconvex convergence of SGD and posed some thought-provoking questions that could set new directions for research.

Existing agent-centric methods have demonstrated outstanding performance on public benchmarks. However, they suffer from high computational overhead and poor scalability as the number of agents to be predicted increases. To address this problem, we introduce the K-nearest neighbor attention with relative pose encoding (KNARPE), a novel attention mechanism allowing the pairwise-relative representation to be used by Transformers. Then, based on KNARPE we present the Heterogeneous Polyline Transformer with Relative pose encoding (HPTR), a hierarchical framework enabling asynchronous token update during the online inference. By sharing contexts among agents and reusing the unchanged contexts, our approach is as efficient as scene-centric methods, while performing on par with state-of-the-art agent-centric methods. Experiments on Waymo and Argoverse-2 datasets show that HPTR achieves superior performance among end-to-end methods that do not apply expensive post-processing or model ensembling.

2023-10-20 Computer Science New submissions 326,CLAIR: Evaluating Image Captions with Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12971,"David Chan, Suzanne Petryk, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, John Canny",New submissions,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"The evaluation of machine-generated image captions poses an interesting yet persistent challenge. Effective evaluation measures must consider numerous dimensions of similarity, including semantic relevance, visual structure, object interactions, caption diversity, and specificity. Existing highly-engineered measures attempt to capture specific aspects, but fall short in providing a holistic score that aligns closely with human judgments. Here, we propose CLAIR, a novel method that leverages the zero-shot language modeling capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate captions. In our evaluations, CLAIR demonstrates a stronger correlation with human judgments of caption quality compared to existing measures. Notably, on Flickr8K-Expert, CLAIR achieves relative correlation improvements over SPICE of 39.6% and over image-augmented methods such as RefCLIP-S of 18.3%. Moreover, CLAIR provides noisily interpretable results by allowing the language model to identify the underlying reasoning behind its assigned score.

While existing methods rely on interactive expert labeling, additional offline datasets, or domain-specific invariances, our approach requires minimal additional assumptions beyond access to expert data. The key insight is to leverage local continuity in the environment dynamics to generate corrective labels. Our method first constructs a dynamics model from the expert demonstration, encouraging local Lipschitz continuity in the learned model. In locally continuous regions, this model allows us to generate corrective labels within the neighborhood of the demonstrations but beyond the actual set of states and actions in the dataset. Training on this augmented data enhances the agent's ability to recover from perturbations and deal with compounding errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our generated labels through experiments in a variety of robotics domains in simulation that have distinct forms of continuity and discontinuity, including classic control problems, drone flying, navigation with high-dimensional sensor observations, legged locomotion, and tabletop manipulation.

Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks, encompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions. We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Code is available at https://github.com/ziqipang/LM4VisualEncoding. "

Our goal is to predict the 3D shape, size, and 6D pose of objects within a single RGB-D image, operating at the category level and eliminating the need for CAD models during inference. While existing self-supervised methods have made strides in this field, they often suffer from inefficiencies arising from non-end-to-end processing, reliance on separate models for different object categories, and slow surface extraction during the training of implicit reconstruction models; thus hindering both the speed and real-world applicability of the 3D recognition process. Our proposed method leverages a multi-stage training pipeline, designed to efficiently transfer synthetic performance to the real-world domain. This approach is achieved through a combination of 2D and 3D supervised losses during the synthetic domain training, followed by the incorporation of 2D supervised and 3D self-supervised losses on real-world data in two additional learning stages. By adopting this comprehensive strategy, our method successfully overcomes the aforementioned limitations and outperforms existing self-supervised 6D pose and size estimation baselines on the NOCS test-set with a 16.4% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D pose estimation while running in near real-time at 5 Hz.

SDEs offer a versatile tool for modeling real-world continuous-time dynamic systems with inherent noise and randomness. Combining SDEs with the powerful inference capabilities of variational methods, enables the learning of representative function distributions through stochastic gradient descent. However, conventional SDEs typically assume the underlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability to capture long-term dependencies. In contrast, fractional Brownian motion (fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for inferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically inefficient. In this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we derive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference of posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of stochastic analysis. Additionally, we provide a closed-form expression to determine optimal approximation coefficients. Furthermore, we propose the use of neural networks to learn the drift, diffusion and control terms within our variational posterior, leading to the variational training of neural-SDEs. In this framework, we also optimize the Hurst index, governing the nature of our fractional noise. Beyond validation on synthetic data, we contribute a novel architecture for variational latent video prediction,-an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, enables the first variational neural-SDE application to video perception.

Each individual image corresponds to a solution with a unique initial condition, which can be computed from the original image using a visual encoder (e.g., a convolutional neural network). Furthermore, the solution for each image exhibits two noteworthy mathematical properties: (a) it can be decomposed into a collection of special solutions of the same one-way wave equations that are first-order autoregressive, with shared coefficient matrices for autoregression, and (b) the product of these coefficient matrices forms a diagonal matrix with the speeds of the wave equations as its diagonal elements. We term this phenomenon hidden waves, as it reveals that, although the speeds of the set of wave equations and autoregressive coefficient matrices are latent, they are both learnable and shared across images. This represents a mathematical invariance across images, providing a new mathematical perspective to understand images. "

In fact, many DN phenomenon were first introduced in literature with that respect, e.g., double descent, grokking. In this study, we look at the training dynamics of the input space partition or linear regions formed by continuous piecewise affine DNs, e.g., networks with (leaky)ReLU nonlinearities. First, we present a novel statistic that encompasses the local complexity (LC) of the DN based on the concentration of linear regions inside arbitrary dimensional neighborhoods around data points. We observe that during training, the LC around data points undergoes a number of phases, starting with a decreasing trend after initialization, followed by an ascent and ending with a final descending trend. Using exact visualization methods, we come across the perplexing observation that during the final LC descent phase of training, linear regions migrate away from training and test samples towards the decision boundary, making the DN input-output nearly linear everywhere else. We also observe that the different LC phases are closely related to the memorization and generalization performance of the DN, especially during grokking. "

Previous works on text-driven motion generation tasks mainly have two limitations: they ignore the key role of fine-grained hand and face controlling in vivid whole-body motion generation, and lack a good alignment between text and motion. To address such limitations, we propose a Text-aligned whOle-body Motion generATiOn framework, named HumanTOMATO, which is the first attempt to our knowledge towards applicable holistic motion generation in this research area. To tackle this challenging task, our solution includes two key designs: (1) a Holistic Hierarchical VQ-VAE (aka H$^2$VQ) and a Hierarchical-GPT for fine-grained body and hand motion reconstruction and generation with two structured codebooks; and (2) a pre-trained text-motion-alignment model to help generated motion align with the input textual description explicitly.

Recent works on VOS employ bottom-up pixel-level memory reading which struggles due to matching noise, especially in the presence of distractors, resulting in lower performance in more challenging data. In contrast, Cutie performs top-down object-level memory reading by adapting a small set of object queries for restructuring and interacting with the bottom-up pixel features iteratively with a query-based object transformer (qt, hence Cutie). The object queries act as a high-level summary of the target object, while high-resolution feature maps are retained for accurate segmentation. Together with foreground-background masked attention, Cutie cleanly separates the semantics of the foreground object from the background.

The model is applied to predict secondary structure content (per-residue level and overall content), protein solubility, and sequencing tasks. Further trained on inverse tasks, the model is rendered capable of designing proteins with these properties as target features. The model is formulated as a general framework, completely prompt-based, and can be adapted for a variety of downstream tasks. We find that adding additional tasks yields emergent synergies that the model exploits in improving overall performance, beyond what would be possible by training a model on each dataset alone. Case studies are presented to validate the method, yielding protein designs specifically focused on structural proteins, but also exploring the applicability in the design of soluble, antimicrobial biomaterials. While our model is trained to ultimately perform 8 distinct tasks, with available datasets it can be extended to solve additional problems. In a broader sense, this work illustrates a form of multiscale modeling that relates a set of ultimate building blocks (here, byte-level utf8 characters that define the nature of the physical system at hand) to complex output. This materiomic scheme captures complex emergent relationships between universal building block and resulting properties via a synergizing learning capacity to express a set of potentialities embedded in the knowledge used in training, via the interplay of universality and diversity.

Based on an autoregressive attention-model, MeLM effectively represents a large multi-particle system consisting of hundreds of millions of neurons, where the interaction potentials are discovered through graph-forming self-attention mechanisms that are then used to identify relationships from emergent structures, while taking advantage of synergies discovered in the training data. We show that the model can solve complex degenerate mechanics design problems and determine novel material architectures across a range of hierarchical levels, providing an avenue for materials discovery and analysis. Looking beyond the demonstrations reported in this paper, we discuss other opportunities in applied mechanics and general considerations about the use of large language models in modeling, design, and analysis that can span a broad spectrum of material properties from mechanical, thermal, optical, to electronic.

Here we propose a custom generative large-language model to enable design of novel spider silk protein sequences to meet complex combinations of target mechanical properties. The model, pretrained on a large set of protein sequences, is fine-tuned on ~1,000 major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) sequences for which associated fiber-level mechanical properties exist, to yield an end-to-end forward and inverse generative strategy. Performance is assessed through: (1), a novelty analysis and protein type classification for generated spidroin sequences through BLAST searches, (2) property evaluation and comparison with similar sequences, (3) comparison of molecular structures, as well as, and (4) a detailed sequence motif analyses. We generate silk sequences with property combinations that do not exist in nature, and develop a deep understanding the mechanistic roles of sequence patterns in achieving overarching key mechanical properties (elastic modulus, strength, toughness, failure strain). The model provides an efficient approach to expand the silkome dataset, facilitating further sequence-structure analyses of silks, and establishes a foundation for synthetic silk design and optimization.

While prior Robust optimization (RO) methods emphasize the downside, i.e., worst-case adversarial demand, BIO also considers the upside to remain resilient like RO while also reaping the rewards of improved average-case performance by overcoming the presence of endogenous outliers. This bimodal strategy is particularly valuable for balancing the tradeoff between lost sales at the store and the costs of cross-channel e-commerce fulfillment, which is at the core of our inventory optimization model. These factors are asymmetric due to the heterogenous behavior of the channels, with a bias towards the former in terms of lost-sales cost and a dependence on network effects for the latter. We provide structural insights about the BIO solution and how it can be tuned to achieve a preferred tradeoff between robustness and the average-case. Our experiments show that significant benefits can be achieved by rethinking traditional approaches to inventory management, which are siloed by channel and location. Using a real-world dataset from a large American omnichannel retail chain, a business value assessment during a peak period indicates over a 15% profitability gain for BIO over RO and other baselines while also preserving the (practical) worst case performance.

Given a dataset of ~10-100 pulsars and O(10^3) timing residuals each, producing a posterior distribution for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can take days to a week. The computational bottleneck arises because the likelihood evaluation required for MCMC is extremely costly when considering the dimensionality of the search space. Fortunately, generating simulated data is fast, so modern simulation-based inference techniques can be brought to bear on the problem. In this paper, we demonstrate how conditional normalizing flows trained on simulated data can be used for extremely fast and accurate estimation of the SGWB posteriors, reducing the sampling time from weeks to a matter of seconds.

This capability offers a tailored training environment for developing neural models suited for speaker diarization and voice activity detection. The acquisition of substantial datasets for speaker diarization often presents a significant challenge, particularly in multi-speaker scenarios. Furthermore, the precise time stamp annotation of speech data is a critical factor for training both speaker diarization and voice activity detection. Our proposed multi-speaker simulator tackles these problems by generating large-scale audio mixtures that maintain statistical properties closely aligned with the input parameters. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-speaker simulator generates audio mixtures with statistical properties that closely align with the input parameters derived from real-world statistics.

A surrogate-assisted sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) method for regression with a general metric-valued response on Euclidean predictors is proposed. The response objects are mapped to a real-valued distance matrix using an appropriate metric and then projected onto a large sample of random unit vectors to obtain scalar-valued surrogate responses. An ensemble estimate of the subspaces for the regression of the surrogate responses versus the predictor is used to estimate the original central space. Under this framework, classical SDR methods such as ordinary least squares and sliced inverse regression are extended. The surrogate-assisted method applies to responses on compact metric spaces including but not limited to Euclidean, distributional, and functional. An extensive simulation experiment demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed surrogate-assisted method on synthetic data compared to existing competing methods where applicable.

Recently, transformer models emerged as a promising avenue to enhance LDCT image quality. However, the success of such models relies on a large amount of paired noisy and clean images, which are often scarce in clinical settings. In the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, masked autoencoders (MAE) have been recognized as an effective label-free self-pretraining method for transformers, due to their exceptional feature representation ability. However, the original pretraining and fine-tuning design fails to work in low-level vision tasks like denoising. In response to this challenge, we redesign the classical encoder-decoder learning model and facilitate a simple yet effective low-level vision MAE, referred to as LoMAE, tailored to address the LDCT denoising problem. Moreover, we introduce an MAE-GradCAM method to shed light on the latent learning mechanisms of the MAE/LoMAE. Additionally, we explore the LoMAE's robustness and generability across a variety of noise levels. Experiments results show that the proposed LoMAE can enhance the transformer's denoising performance and greatly relieve the dependence on the ground truth clean data. It also demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalizability over a spectrum of noise levels. "

Specifically, we use the proximity between points in the feature space learned by the RF to re-write random forest predictions exactly as a weighted average of the target labels of training data points. This linearity facilitates a local notion of explainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model prediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements established methods like SHAP, which instead generates attributions for a model prediction across dimensions of the feature space. We demonstrate this approach in the context of a bond pricing model trained on US corporate bond trades, and compare our approach to various existing approaches to model explainability. "

In this article, we substantially enhance the flexibility of such methodology by introducing a nonparametrically imbued distributional constraints on the weights, and developing a general framework leveraging the maximum entropy principle and tools from optimal transport. The key idea is to ensure that the maximum entropy weight adjusted empirical distribution of the observed data is close to a pre-specified probability distribution in terms of the optimal transport metric while allowing for subtle departures. The versatility of the framework is demonstrated in the context of three disparate applications where data re-weighting is warranted to satisfy side constraints on the optimization problem at the heart of the statistical task: namely, portfolio allocation, semi-parametric inference for complex surveys, and ensuring algorithmic fairness in machine learning algorithms.

Precisely predicting the present price of an option enables investors to make informed and efficient decisions. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method for forecasting the prices of SPY (ETF) option based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) and self-attention mechanism. We first partitioned the raw dataset into 15 subsets according to moneyness and days to maturity criteria. For each subset, we matched the corresponding U.S. government bond rates and Implied Volatility Indices. This segmentation allows for a more insightful exploration of the impacts of risk-free rates and underlying volatility on option pricing. Next, we built four different machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), self-attention LSTM, and self-attention GRU in comparison to the traditional binomial model. The empirical result shows that self-attention GRU with historical data outperforms other models due to its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and leverage the contextual information embedded in the historical data. Finally, in order to unveil the ""black box"" of artificial intelligence, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret and analyze the prediction results of the self-attention GRU model with historical data. This provides insights into the significance and contributions of different input features on the pricing of American-style options. "

In this paper we construct a neural likelihood approximation for integer valued time series data using causal convolutions, which allows us to evaluate the likelihood of the whole time series in parallel.

This study proposes a novel deep medical image segmentation framework, called DA-TransUNet, aiming to introduce the Transformer and dual attention block into the encoder and decoder of the traditional U-shaped architecture.

Following the traditional hybrid prediction coding framework, most learned methods generally adopt the motion estimation motion compensation (MEMC) method to remove inter-frame redundancy. However, inaccurate motion vector (MV) usually lead to the distortion of reconstructed frame. In addition, most approaches ignore the spatial and channel redundancy. To solve above problems, we propose a motion-aware and spatial-temporal-channel contextual coding based video compression network (MASTC-VC), which learns the latent representation and uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) to capture the characteristics of intra-frame pixels and inter-frame motion. Specifically, we design a multiscale motion-aware module (MS-MAM) to estimate spatial-temporal-channel consistent motion vector by utilizing the multiscale motion prediction information in a coarse-to-fine way. On the top of it, we further propose a spatial-temporal-channel contextual module (STCCM), which explores the correlation of latent representation to reduce the bit consumption from spatial, temporal and channel aspects respectively.

The embedding of such manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the manifold and maximum likelihood can be used optimize the network parameters. Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that density aligns with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However, unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold is not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis with degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space representation. Towards this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix to have few prominent and orthogonal basis functions. Canonical manifold flow yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and consequently a better approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.

A newly developed measure (density cluster separability index, DCSI) aims to quantify these two characteristics and can also be used as a CVI. Extensive experiments on synthetic data indicate that DCSI correlates strongly with the performance of DBSCAN measured via the adjusted rand index (ARI) but lacks robustness when it comes to multi-class data sets with overlapping classes that are ill-suited for density-based hard clustering.

Assuming a trained Supervised Classification model, explanations can be obtained via counterfactual analysis: a counterfactual explanation of an instance indicates how this instance should be minimally modified so that the perturbed instance is classified in the desired class by the Machine Learning classification model. Most of the Counterfactual Analysis literature focuses on the single-instance single-counterfactual setting, in which the analysis is done for one single instance to provide one single explanation. Taking a stakeholder's perspective, in this paper we introduce the so-called collective counterfactual explanations. By means of novel Mathematical Optimization models, we provide a counterfactual explanation for each instance in a group of interest, so that the total cost of the perturbations is minimized under some linking constraints. Making the process of constructing counterfactuals collective instead of individual enables us to detect the features that are critical to the entire dataset to have the individuals classified in the desired class. Our methodology allows for some instances to be treated individually, performing the collective counterfactual analysis for a fraction of records of the group of interest. This way, outliers are identified and handled appropriately. Under some assumptions on the classifier and the space in which counterfactuals are sought, finding collective counterfactuals is reduced to solving a convex quadratic linearly constrained mixed integer optimization problem, which, for datasets of moderate size, can be solved to optimality using existing solvers. The performance of our approach is illustrated on real-world datasets, demonstrating its usefulness. "

In the case of probabilistic and uncertainty-aware models, it is necessary to understand not only the reasons for the predictions themselves, but also the model's level of confidence in those predictions. In this paper, we show how existing methods in explainability can be extended to uncertainty-aware models and how such extensions can be used to understand the sources of uncertainty in a model's predictive distribution. In particular, by adapting permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots, we demonstrate that novel insights into model behaviour may be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the log-likelihood of the ground truth labels under that distribution. With experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the utility of these approaches in understanding both the sources of uncertainty and their impact on model performance. "

Orsi",Cross-lists,Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"For many patients, current ovarian cancer treatments offer limited clinical benefit. For some therapies, it is not possible to predict patients' responses, potentially exposing them to the adverse effects of treatment without any therapeutic benefit. As part of the automated prediction of treatment effectiveness in ovarian cancer using histopathological images (ATEC23) challenge, we evaluated the effectiveness of deep learning to predict whether a course of treatment including the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab could contribute to remission or prevent disease progression for at least 6 months in a set of 282 histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) from 78 ovarian cancer patients. Our approach used a pretrained Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT) to extract region-level features and an attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) model to aggregate features and classify whole slides. The optimal HIPT-ABMIL model had an internal balanced accuracy of 60.2% +- 2.9% and an AUC of 0.646 +- 0.033. Histopathology-specific model pretraining was found to be beneficial to classification performance, though hierarchical transformers were not, with a ResNet feature extractor achieving similar performance. Due to the dataset being small and highly heterogeneous, performance was variable across 5-fold cross-validation folds, and there were some extreme differences between validation and test set performance within folds. The model did not generalise well to tissue microarrays, with accuracy worse than random chance. It is not yet clear whether ovarian cancer WSIs contain information that can be used to accurately predict treatment response, with further validation using larger, higher-quality datasets required.

Nelson, Vicki Yang, Kathryn Edin, Matthew J. Salganik",Cross-lists,Applications (stat.AP); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Why are life trajectories difficult to predict? We investigated this question through in-depth qualitative interviews with 40 families sampled from a multi-decade longitudinal study. Our sampling and interviewing process were informed by the earlier efforts of hundreds of researchers to predict life outcomes for participants in this study. The qualitative evidence we uncovered in these interviews combined with a well-known mathematical decomposition of prediction error helps us identify some origins of unpredictability and create a new conceptual framework. Our specific evidence and our more general framework suggest that unpredictability should be expected in many life trajectory prediction tasks, even in the presence of complex algorithms and large datasets. Our work also provides a foundation for future empirical and theoretical work on unpredictability in human lives. "

Mantiuk, Kede Ma",Cross-lists,Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"High dynamic range (HDR) imaging has gained increasing popularity for its ability to faithfully reproduce the luminance levels in natural scenes. Accordingly, HDR image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial but has been superficially treated. The majority of existing IQA models are developed for and calibrated against low dynamic range (LDR) images, which have been shown to be poorly correlated with human perception of HDR image quality. In this work, we propose a family of HDR IQA models by transferring the recent advances in LDR IQA. The key step in our approach is to specify a simple inverse display model that decomposes an HDR image to a set of LDR images with different exposures, which will be assessed by existing LDR quality models. The local quality scores of each exposure are then aggregated with the help of a simple well-exposedness measure into a global quality score for each exposure, which will be further weighted across exposures to obtain the overall quality score. When assessing LDR images, the proposed HDR quality models reduce gracefully to the original LDR ones with the same performance. Experiments on four human-rated HDR image datasets demonstrate that our HDR quality models are consistently better than existing IQA methods, including the HDR-VDP family. Moreover, we demonstrate their strengths in perceptual optimization of HDR novel view synthesis. "

Conformal inference algorithms construct prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. These guarantees fail to hold in the face of distribution shift, which is precisely when reliable uncertainty quantification can be most useful. We propose a novel algorithm for constructing prediction sets with PAC guarantees in the label shift setting. This method estimates the predicted probabilities of the classes in a target domain, as well as the confusion matrix, then propagates uncertainty in these estimates through a Gaussian elimination algorithm to compute confidence intervals for importance weights. Finally, it uses these intervals to construct prediction sets. We evaluate our approach on five datasets: the CIFAR-10, ChestX-Ray and Entity-13 image datasets, the tabular CDC Heart dataset, and the AGNews text dataset. Our algorithm satisfies the PAC guarantee while producing smaller, more informative, prediction sets compared to several baselines. "

Zerkle, Eric S. Davis, Robert Broilo, Cristian Pantea",New submissions,Signal Processing (eess.SP),"We present a new method for calculating the temperature profile in high explosive (HE) material using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To train/test the CNN, we have developed a hybrid experiment/simulation method for collecting acoustic and temperature data. We experimentally heat cylindrical containers of HE material until detonation/deflagration, where we continuously measure the acoustic bursts through the HE using multiple acoustic transducers lined around the exterior container circumference. However, measuring the temperature profile in the HE in experiment would require inserting a high number of thermal probes, which would disrupt the heating process. Thus, we use two thermal probes, one at the HE center and one at the wall. We then use finite element simulation of the heating process to calculate the temperature distribution, and correct the simulated temperatures based on the experimental center and wall temperatures. We calculate temperature errors on the order of 15{\deg}C, which is approximately 12% of the range of temperatures in the experiment. We also investigate how the algorithm accuracy is affected by the number of acoustic receivers used to collect each measurement and the resolution of the temperature prediction. This work provides a means of assessing the safety status of HE material, which cannot be achieved using existing temperature measurement methods. Additionally, it has implications for range of other applications where internal temperature profile measurements would provide critical information. These applications include detecting chemical reactions, observing thermodynamic processes like combustion, monitoring metal or plastic casting, determining the energy density in thermal storage capsules, and identifying abnormal battery operation.

Weldegebriel, Neal Patwari",New submissions,Signal Processing (eess.SP),"Future mobile ad hoc networks will share spectrum between many users. Channels will be assigned on the fly to guarantee signal and interference power requirements for requested links. Channel losses must be re-estimated between many pairs of users as they move and as environmental conditions change. Computational complexity must be low, precluding the use of some accurate but computationally intensive site-specific channel models. Channel model errors must be low, precluding the use of standard statistical channel models. We propose a new channel model, CELF, which uses channel loss measurements from a deployed network in the area and a Bayesian linear regression method to estimate a site-specific loss field for the area. The loss field is explainable as the site's 'shadowing' of the radio propagation across the area of interest, but it requires no site-specific terrain or building information. Then, for any arbitrary pair of transmitter and receiver positions, CELF sums the loss field near the link line to estimate its channel loss. We use extensive measurements to show that CELF lowers the variance of channel estimates by up to 56%. It outperforms 3 popular machine learning methods in variance reduction and training efficiency.

Ali Pourmousavi, Wen L. Soong, Andrew J. Black, Jon A. R. Liisberg, Julian Lemos-Vinasco",New submissions,Signal Processing (eess.SP); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),"Many smart grid applications involve data mining, clustering, classification, identification, and anomaly detection, among others. These applications primarily depend on the measurement of similarity, which is the distance between different time series or subsequences of a time series. The commonly used time series distance measures, namely Euclidean Distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), do not quantify the flexible nature of electricity usage data in terms of temporal dynamics. As a result, there is a need for a new distance measure that can quantify both the amplitude and temporal changes of electricity time series for smart grid applications, e.g., demand response and load profiling. This paper introduces a novel distance measure to compare electricity usage patterns. The method consists of two phases that quantify the effort required to reshape one time series into another, considering both amplitude and temporal changes. The proposed method is evaluated against ED and DTW using real-world data in three smart grid applications. Overall, the proposed measure outperforms ED and DTW in accurately identifying the best load scheduling strategy, anomalous days with irregular electricity usage, and determining electricity users' behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Backprojection Transformer termed MBT for RSISR. MBT incorporates the backprojection learning strategy into a Transformer framework. It consists of Scale-aware Backprojection-based Transformer Layers (SPTLs) for scale-aware low-resolution feature learning and Context-aware Backprojection-based Transformer Blocks (CPTBs) for hierarchical feature learning. A backprojection-based reconstruction module (PRM) is also introduced to enhance the hierarchical features for image reconstruction. MBT stands out by efficiently learning low-resolution features without excessive modules for high-resolution processing, resulting in lower computational resources. Experiment results on UCMerced and AID datasets demonstrate that MBT obtains state-of-the-art results compared to other leading methods. "

We ask, which properties of a speaker's voice are captured and investigate to which extent do individual embedding vector components sign responsible for them, using the concept of Shapley values. Our findings show that certain speaker-specific acoustic-phonetic properties can be fairly well predicted from the speaker embedding, while the investigated more abstract voice quality features cannot.

We propose a product-of-experts-type model utilizing Gaussian mixture experts and study configurations that admit an analytic expression for $ f_Y (\,\cdot\,, t) $. In particular, with a focus on image processing, we derive conditions for models acting on filter-, wavelet-, and shearlet responses. Our construction naturally allows the model to be trained simultaneously over the entire diffusion horizon using empirical Bayes. We show numerical results for image denoising where our models are competitive while being tractable, interpretable, and having only a small number of learnable parameters. As a byproduct, our models can be used for reliable noise estimation, allowing blind denoising of images corrupted by heteroscedastic noise. "
